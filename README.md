# Resume

The goal of this project is to investigate the modulation of shrub-saplings
interactions at the community scale.

We set up an experiment near Murcia in collaboration with the group of the
professor Susana Bautista of the University of Alicante.

This git repository contains all the datas and codes needed to compute the
analysis.
