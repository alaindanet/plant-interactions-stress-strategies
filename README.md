# Resume

I want to set up an experiment in Alicante about interaction modulations following stress gradients (water & grazing).
Take a functional approach to link stress gradient hypothesis to Grime's concept of CSR.

# Meetings

## With Susana
Susana said we should do a treatment "alone/community" to have an insight about how each species responds to nursing effect.
She also advises to keep a rabbit treatment.

## With Cyrille (20/01/2015)

### Concept
- Be careful about originality of my question.
- Concept of Stress Gradient Hypothesis and Grime's CSR triangle are hazy concepts.
- The concept of Grime is a bit old-fashioned. We go toward a quantitive traits approach. 
- Take one species for each Grime's type is not in agreement with my statement to reach generality with my approach. That's not make a comparative approach. 
- There is not environmental measure in my set up.
- Make my questions more clear
- Decide which traits are relevant in my case, may be phenologic date (very plastic).

### Experimental

- Have 4 species by type (more generality) and more individuals in my community (have a fraction of survival instead of 0/1 data, it's easier to analyse). 
- Replace alone/community by a monoculture/mixture treatment.
- Dangerous to have a rabbit treatment. transplant saplings are always greener than natural vegetation, so rabbits jump on.
- Co-variables to know what is going on: temperature (temperature coin battery or infrared temperature gun), soil moisture, light transmission (LAI), water potential (idea of stress,pressure chamber), MDMC (leaf thickness).
- Have a continous measure of allometry relationship between (height + encombrement) and biomass. So keep saplings to do that.

## With Susana (4/02/2015)

- Keep grazing treatment in my proposal. Relevant because no results exist about that.
- Better to put one sapling in monoculture treatment.
- Artemisia is not a good facilitator of Antyllis (Mart's results).

## With Sonia (13/02/2015)

- Keep 3 saplings in monoculture treatment
- Keep may be one stress treatment (grazing) and collaborate with Susana student for same protocol with water stress
