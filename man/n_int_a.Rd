\title{Additive Intensity Neighbor Index}
\usage{
patch contains the performance of individuals with a neighbor.
open contains the performance of individual without a neighbor.
}
\arguments{
\item{open}{a vector containing non-negatives real values.}

\item{patch}{a vector containing non-negatives real values.}
}
\value{
a vector containing the index values.
}
\description{
Additive Intensity Neighbor Index
}
\details{
This function computes the Additive Intensity Neighbor Index developed by
DÃ¬az-Sierra et al. (2016). Positive values indicates a positive net effect of
the neighbor (facilitation) whereas negative values indicates a negative one
(competition).
