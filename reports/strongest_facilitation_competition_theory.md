# Introduction

NOTES: This document has been inspired by the reading of Putman's book (1994), Craine's debate by Grime and Tilman (2005, 2005 in Journal of Ecology) and my work in Alicante.

Recent publications of Soliveres, Smit and Maestre (2015) underlines the importance of considering the importance of taking in account ecological optimum in facilitative interactions. They suggest that more a species is far from its ecological optimum, more it should be facilitated. But they failed to suggest a way to do that, and in my opinion, it's because we don't know how to measure an environmental gradient and so, it seems extremely difficult to measure a distance from an ecological optimum.

Another thing is that facilitation and in general, balance between competition and facilitation (Nurse/saplings interactions) failed to do the rapprochement preexisting theories (Grime & Tilman ones, but see Michalet et al. 2006).

I think that facilitation research missed something that competition research let us and permit us to better understand species interactions.
Functional traits, as representing of eco-physiological of the plants, can give us more answers on the context dependence of saplings/nurse interaction.

NOTES: Contrary to Grime's theory, Tilman is a full theoretician/empiricist scientist. One of a weakness of the Grime's theory is that is not supported by mathematical model as Tilman always does.

# Objectives

- Build a more rigorous conceptual framework which encompasses existing theories which testable hypothesis.

# State of the art in existing plant theories

## Competition for nutrient

In Tilman's theory, the strongest competitor is the one which is able to grow with the lower amount of resource (The lowest R).
The Tilman's R suggest that Nutrient depletion by the plants is always the strongest factor which determines the vegetation composition.One of this experiment suggests that slower-growing species have the lowest R and because of that, they can exclude fast-growing species from unproductive environment. On the contrary, Grime thinks that in unproductive environment, the greater pressure on the plants are the availability of the resources, so the most important mechanism is the ability of conserve the resources in face of unpredictable availability.

NOTES: add the discussion about homogeneous versus heterogeneous low nutrient supply.

## Competition for light


# Hypothesis in link with Tilman (Competition does not decrease along the stress gradient)

In productive environment, the focal species (saplings or, e.g. facilitated) don't need of protection. So, it suffers of the shadow and water/nutrients consumption by the nurse (e.g adult plant).

In medium environment, the amelioration of ressources compensates the shadow and competition. The resources are still enough for facilitated and nurse.

In harsh environment.

# Hypothesis in link with Grime (Competition decreases along the stress gradient)


# How to test it in the nurse/saplings interactions ? ( Only with Biotic contraints)

Classically in nurse/saplings interactions studies, we have the outcome of interaction importance (competition and facilitation) by comparing the performance of the saplings under a nurse and alone. 

## Water stress

We can assess how the saplings answer to water stress ($\deltaC^13$ in the leaves) and how the saplings strategies is affected (SLA differences). 

## Nutrient interaction

We can assess how the nurse ameliorates nutrients content (the soil under nurse alone) and compare with the resource uptake in the saplings (C:N:P content in the leaves). 

## Shading tolerance

A relatively neglect thing in facilitation papers.

The shading tolerance is defined as the capacity to maintain a photosynthetic activity although the decreasing of Photosynthetic Active Radiation (PAR) available. Maestre et al. (2003) did it but it did not find other relevant examples.
Futhermore, to investigate the shading tolerance on the saplings, it would be necessary to measure photosynthetic activity difference between open and patch.
