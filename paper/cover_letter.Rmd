Please find enclosed our revised manuscript entitled "Species diversity promotes
facilitation under stressful conditions", which we resubmit for consideration in the
Oikos special issue "The role of plant facilitation in mediating climate change
impact on biodiversity".

We carefully adressed the comments of the editor and the two reviewers. That
included the revision of the introduction to be closer to the scope of the
study, added to more explicit introduction of the objectives (including
functional traits). We also added information about the experimental setting and
also added a part about environmental measurements. We furthermore clarified the
link between selection effects and competitive dominance in benefiaciary
communities. Finally, we reframed the discussion about functional traits to tone
down some sentences and presenting alternative hypothesis. We finally improved
the "conclusion & perspectives" paragraph and improved the clarity of the
figures.

We believe that our manuscript is now much clearer and we believe that we
answered all the concerns of the reviewers and the editor.

In our resubmission, we submit the manuscript along with a version highlighting
the changes made since the first submission. The response letter contains the
point by point response to the comments as well the changes made to address
them.
