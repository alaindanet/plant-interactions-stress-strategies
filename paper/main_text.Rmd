# Abstract {-}

Climate change is expected to lead to more frequent and severe droughts,
constituting a growing threat to biodiversity, especially in drylands. Positive
plant-plant interactions, such as facilitation provided by nurse plants to
beneficiary communities, have the potential to mitigate those effects. This
requires taking into account the species richness of those beneficiary
communities, an aspect that has been overlooked so far. Here, we investigated
this effect in a Mediterranean semiarid abandoned cropland, where we
transplanted sapling beneficiary communities of either one or three species
either under a nurse or in open microsites and further crossed this design with
manipulation of soil moisture. Facilitation on survival and biomass was only
observed when beneficiary communities were species diverse and without watering.
When beneficiary communities were either under a nurse or watered, the
beneficiary community biomass response was complementary: species showed a
higher increase in biomass than expected in monoculture. This response to
alleviated stress was further reflected in a shift in beneficiary species traits
towards a low-stress profile. Nurses also generated negative selection effects
regardless of the water stress level, meaning that nurse facilitated the more
the most maladapted species. Our results highlight the multiple pathways
through which nurse species could mitigate the loss of
biodiversity due to climate change. Our study highlights the mechanisms by which
nurse plants can maintain higher biodiversity and biomass production in
drylands, and suggests that it might be a useful tool to mitigate effects of the
projected increases in severity and frequency of droughts across the world.

# Introduction {-}

Drought events are a major cause of plant mortality and of reduced biomass
production [@allen_global_2010; @park_williams_temperature_2013; @hartmann_research_2018]. Drylands
are characterised by limited water availability for plants and animals, leading
to reduced growth and increased mortality compared to more mesic environments.
Climate change already results in increases in the frequency of extreme heat
events that were reported in most parts of the world over the last decades and
are expected to increase everywhere [@lee_ipcc_2023]. Most regions will experience
more severe and/or more frequent droughts in the future under a +2°C scenario
[@lee_ipcc_2023]. Such conditions have detrimental effects on plants, especially the
ones that are not adapted to such prolonged and frequent dry periods. Such
changes in growth and mortality are likely to alter plant community composition,
biodiversity and ecosystem functioning of these habitats [@muller_drought_2022].
Improving our understanding of how drought impacts growth, survival and
competitive interactions, and whether there are mechanisms that might buffer the
detrimental effects of drought, are critical to predict the future of ecological
communities in a drier world.

The potential for buffering the detrimental effects of drought is particularly
relevant/crucial in drylands, where plants referred to as “benefactors” or
“nurses” facilitate other plants (“beneficiaries”) and are central/important
drivers of those communities’ structure and functioning
[@anthelme_positive_2007; @michalet_biotic_2006; @maestre_structure_2016]. Nurse
plants can improve environmental conditions beneath their canopy, e.g. by
decreasing the soil erosion, buffering the daily fluctuations in temperature,
and increasing water retention [@callaway_positive_2007]. Such facilitative effects have
been linked to
increased species richness [@gross_positive_2008;
@cavieres_facilitative_2014], increased
diversity in community composition [@kikvidze_effects_2015], and play a tremendous
role in large scale ecosystem properties such as productivity [@cardinale_species_2002;
@wright_overlooked_2017], resilience [@kefi_local_2007; @kefi_spatial_2007] and the spatial
distribution of species in drylands. Nurse plants, by improving environmental
conditions, have therefore to mitigate the effects of increasing severity and
frequency of drought events on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.

However, the facilitative effects provided by nurse plants can be complex and
dependent on the abiotic and biotic contexts. The net outcome of
nurse-beneficiary interactions has been shown to depend on the distance of the
beneficiary to its physiological optimum, in such a way that the most
mal-adapted species are the most facilitated [@liancourt_stress_2005;
@graff_species_2017]. Also, the net effect of a nurse on a beneficiary depends
not only on the level, but also on the type of stress [Stress-Gradient
Hypothesis, @bertness_positive_1994; @maestre_refining_2009;
@graff_species_2017]. Furthermore, nurse plants can indirectly alter the
interactions among beneficiaries [@schob_direct_2013; @michalet_direct_2017]. In
sum, the abiotic (the type and level of stress) and the biotic contexts (the
identity of the nurse and the beneficiaries) makes it hard so far to predict the
effects of facilitation expected in complex, species-rich, beneficiary
communities.

Community assembly theory provides key predictions about the outcome of
nurse-beneficiary interactions in species diverse communities. Facilitation can
be seen as an expansion of the niche of beneficiary species [@bruno_inclusion_2003; @koffel_competition_2021], e.g. by making
environmental conditions suitable for a larger range of species, such as those
that prefer higher moisture. This expanded niche space is likely better
exploited by species-rich beneficiary communities that are able to use different
aspects of this new resource space, e.g. by having contrasted water use
strategies, i.e. higher ‘niche complementarity’ [@cardinale_species_2002;
@loreau_partitioning_2001]. Furthermore, at the microsite scale, nurse plants
increase habitat heterogeneity, providing more available niche spaces for
beneficiary plants [@obrien_shift_2017]. Nurse species might also alter
competitive hierarchy among beneficiary species which in turn alter their
dominance [i.e. ‘selection effects’, @loreau_partitioning_2001] such as most
mal-adapted species are disproportionately facilitated compared to well adapted
species [@liancourt_stress_2005; @graff_species_2017].
Complementarity and selection effects are two mechanisms holding the links
between species richness and biomass production in grasslands, species richness
was often reported to increase complementarity while having variable effects on
selection [@loreau_partitioning_2001; @fargione_selection_2007]. Investigating how
facilitation provided by a nurse affects complementarity and selection in
beneficiary communities may therefore improve our understanding of the
mechanisms behind facilitation and bridge the gap between facilitation and
ecosystem functioning research areas [@wright_overlooked_2017].

By modifying local environmental conditions, nurse plants are also expected to
alter the physiology and resource exploitation strategies of the beneficiary
plants which in turn can be assessed using leaf functional traits. In harsh
environments, beneficiary plants located beneath and within a nurse were
reported to display higher variability but more homogeneity in leaf trait
composition, but also less stressed- leaf trait syndromes
[@schob_foundation_2012; @schob_direct_2013; @schob_trait-based_2017;
@danet_nurse_2017; @danet_effects_2018]. Accounting for how the presence of the
nurse and water stress modulate functional traits is therefore a valuable way to
further understand the mechanisms by which facilitation operates on beneficiary
plants.

Here we report on an in situ experiment in a Mediterranean abandoned cropland
where we hypothesised that facilitation provided by nurse plants in drylands is
stronger for diverse than for monospecific beneficiary assemblages, and that
this facilitation effect is lower under lower water stress. We addressed three
specific questions: 1) How does species richness affect nurse net effects on
survival and biomass? 2) How do nurse plants alter functional traits of
beneficiary communities in response to water stress? 3) How do nurse plants
affect complementarity and competitive hierarchy in beneficiary communities? To
answer those questions, we implemented a fully factorial design where we
transplanted sapling communities of three different beneficiary species either
in monoculture or in mixture, either in open or in a nurse-patch microsites. We
further manipulated water supplementation to alter the level of water stress
experienced by the beneficiary communities. To investigate the mechanisms behind
nurse effects on beneficiary communities, we further measured leaf functional
traits related to resource acquisition strategy and assessed how nurses affect
beneficiary species complementarity and competitive hierarchy.

## Study area {-}

The experiment was conducted in 2016 in the Murcia region, Southeastern Spain
(37°57’33“N, 1°00’17”W – 172 m a.s.l.). The region’s climate is semiarid
Mediterranean with a very high year to year variability. Annual rainfall follows
a bimodal distribution, with two rainy seasons (spring and autumn) and a very
dry and warm summer. Mean annual rainfall is 297 mm, and monthly average ranges
from 3 mm in July to 36 mm in October. Mean annual temperature is 18.6 °C and
range from an average of 10.6 °C in January to 27.6 °C in August (Murcia
Meteorological Station, 38°00’7’‘N - 1°10’15”W- 61 m a.s.l.; period: 1984-2010).
The year of 2016 was part of a series of 9 consecutive drier years from 2011 to
2020 in the region (Standardised Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index over one
year, https://spei.csic.es/index.html). Soils are thin (20-50 cm), of silt-loam
type (32% sand, 47% silt, 21% clay), and basic (pH = 8.7). The area is a mosaic
of moderately steep slopes covered by alpha-grass (*Stipa tenacissima*) steppes
and abandoned agricultural terraces built on the streambeds. The agricultural
terraces in the study site were abandoned in the 80s and 90s and progressively
colonised by forbs and shrubs (Fig. 1a). The extant perennial vegetation is
dominated by the shrub species *Artemisia herba-alba*, *Anthyllis cytisoides*
and *Pistacia lentiscus*.


## Experimental design {-}

To assess nursing effects on beneficiary communities, we set the beneficiary
communities either under the canopy of a nurse plant, Artemisia herba-alba, or
in open microsites. Artemisia herba-alba is a pioneer and common non-palatable
species in drylands [@alados_association_2006; @verwijmeren_drought_2014]. It was
reported to be partially phytotoxic, producing strong anti-germination compounds
which however were not reported to affect negatively sapling growth
[@arroyo_phytotoxic_2018]. As far as we know, Artemisia herba-alba was not reported to improve
local abiotic environment before this study.

To assess how nurse effects varied with the species richness of the beneficiary
communities, we transplanted under the nurse either one beneficiary species
growing in monoculture, or a mix of three species (Fig. 1c). We selected three
different beneficiary species, so we had 4 different understorey community types
in total (3 monocultures and 1 mixture). We selected three common shrub species
of the Mediterranean steppes as beneficiary species, namely *Anthyllis
citisoides*, *Dorycnium pentaphyllum* and *Pistacia lentiscus*, which are
commonly found to co-occur in the same communities [@amat_community_2015]. All
those species have characteristics which are considered to be adaptations to the
semi-arid climates. *Anthyllis citisoides* is a drought-avoider and sheds its
leaves during summer, thereby decreasing the transpiring area
[@haase_photosynthetic_2000]. *Pistacia lentiscus* is a late successional
evergreen shrub which can develop a dense root system at the sapling stage
within one year after transplantation [@maestre_positive_2003]. It can also
increase the water storage in its leaves during the hot and dry season
[@maestre_mechanisms_2004], and the thick cuticle of its leaves
[@coste_flore_1937] limits the loss of water by evapotranspiration. *Dorycnium
pentaphyllum* is a low-growing species known for its resistance to water stress
[@caravaca_use_2003]. Its leaves are composed of segments which decrease the
transpiring surface.

We assessed how the level of water stress modulated the nurse effects on
beneficiary communities by supplementing beneficiary communities with 1.5L of
water by microsite 8 times during 2016 around 6pm to avoid the strongest
evapotranspiration, once a month in spring and summer (i.e. March, April, May,
June, July, and August) and every two months otherwise (i.e. January and
October). We did so by emptying one water bottle by microsite. We measured soil
moisture 16 hours after watering in January, March, and June using a TDR (Fig. S1).

We used a fully factorial design that included 3 treatments with two levels
each: microsite (nurse patch/ open),  assemblage diversity (monospecific /
diverse), and watering (yes / no), with three types of monospecific assemblages,
one per each target beneficiary species, resulting in 16 combinations of
treatments and assemblages, each of them replicated 20 times. The treatment
combinations were distributed among 3 terraces (Fig. 1b) so that treatments were
replicated 6 to 7 times per terrace. Because of the abundance of grazers in the
area (mainly rabbits), every terrace was fenced with 1.80 metres height wire
fences and reinforced by chicken wire extending from about 60 cm above ground to
20 cm below ground.

## Experimental setting and measurements

r2bm <- setNames(round(unlist(biomass_modelling_r2[1,][c(2, 3)]), 2), c("R2", "adj"))
```

The transplantation of beneficiary communities was done between October 23 and
November 4, 2015, into planting holes (hereafter named “microsite”, Fig. 1) of
approximately 25×25×25 cm dug manually. Each hole was the recipient of one
beneficiary community. The holes benefiting from the nurse plant effect
(hereafter named “nurse patch”) were located below the canopy of the benefactor,
about 20 cm apart from the main stem of the plant, and oriented northward to
maximise the shading effect. Each nurse received one hole only (i.e. one
beneficiary community). One week before planting saplings, the area received
about 40 mm of natural rainfall (affecting all terraces equally), which provided
excellent initial moisture conditions for the planted saplings. The holes were
randomly attributed to the different treatments.
The saplings composing the beneficiary communities were about 6 months at the
time of transplantation and were grown in the open air in a nursery located 30
km from the study site (Viveros Muzalé S.L., Abanilla, Spain). They were grown
in controlled wet conditions in 200 ml containers with a mixture of peat and
coconut fibre, containing several individuals of the same species. Plants were
bought in small pots. We planted three pots per hole, following a triangular
arrangement in which the plant pots were equally distant from each other
(approximately 10 cm). To exclude the initial variation in the number of
individuals per microsite, we only considered holes in which at least one
individual from the original container survived in January, and removed
supernumerary individuals by cutting their stems at their basis.


In order to estimate the total biomass of the beneficiary plants during the
course of the experiment, we estimated the allometric relationship linking total
biomass to basal diameter and maximal height with a species effect
[@catchpole_estimating_1992; @nafus_multispecies_2009]. We put aside twelve
individuals of each species in November (i.e. at the time we collected the
seedlings from the nursery), and dried them during 65°C for three days to
measure total biomass of each individual. We log-transformed total
biomass, basal diameter and vegetative height prior to modelling. The R² of the
model was quite high ($R^2$ = `r r2bm["R2"]`, adjusted $R^2$ = `r r2bm["adj"]`),
and we found a good  agreement between predicted and observed values (Fig. S2,
see estimated coefficients in Table S1). This allometric relationship provided
an estimation of total plant biomass based on the non-lethal measurement of plant height
and stem diameter in the field (considering either only basal diameter or
estimated total
biomass did not alter our conclusions, see Fig. S3).  Basal diameter was
measured using a digital caliper at around 1 cm above the ground. To increase
accuracy of the repeated measurements on the same plant, (1) we left a mark at
the exact place where the first basal diameter measurement was taken and (2)
measurements were done on the same side of the stem. Maximum height was measured
using a measuring tape as the vertical distance between the soil and the top
leafed stem. During the experiment, we measured the performance of individual
beneficiary plants by recording (1) their survival and (2) their total biomass
(using the above allometric relationship) from January to October 2016 (10
months).


To better understand the underlying mechanism through which nurse plants affect
the beneficiary communities, we analysed how experimental treatments affected
leaf functional traits in beneficiary communities. We focused on two leaf traits
known to reflect different resource acquisition strategies, Leaf Dry Matter
Content (LDMC) and Specific Leaf Area [SLA, @perez-harguindeguy_new_2013]. The
leaves of beneficiary plants were collected and processed in March 2016 (4
months after the plantation) following guidelines from
@perez-harguindeguy_new_2013. We collected only leaves without traces of
disease, grazing or senescence, that were mature and most exposed to sunlight
(i.e. close to the top of the main stem). We collected a small number of leaves,
and only from the most healthy individuals, as to assume that their response to
experimental conditions would  not be affected by the leaf sampling. We
collected 3 leaves per plant for *P. lentiscus*, 5 leaves for *A. citisoides*
and 10 leaves for *D. pentaphyllum*, so that the overall dry leaf biomass of
each sample was high enough to accurately weight them. Leaves from each
individual were stored in a plastic tube with a humid tissue to limit
desiccation and stored in thermally-isolated cooler for transportation. Leaves
were then  first rehydrated with deionised water for several minutes, weighted,
scanned, and then dried at least 48h at 72°C. Once dry, we weighted individual
leaves to compute LDMC and SLA. We a priori selected a random subset of
microsites to be sampled and then we effectively sampled only the subset that
met the above conditions, to reach a minimal sampling size per treatment
combination of 7 samples for SLA (max 36), 13 samples for LDMC (max 75, Table
S2).


## Data analysis {-}

The analysis of the data consisted in two steps. We modelled the survival, the
biomass, and the leaf functional traits of the beneficiary communities to assess
the effects of experimental treatments. We then used the predicted values of survival
and biomass to compute the net effects of the nurse on beneficiary communities,
and the predicted values of biomass to compute complementarity and selection
effects.

### Modelling survival and biomass of beneficiary communities {-}

We used mixed-effect generalised linear models to test whether the presence of
the nurse affected the performance of beneficiary communities, i.e. their total
biomass and their survival, for different species richness (monoculture or mix
of three species) and levels of water stress.  The presence of the nurse, the
species richness of the beneficiary communities and the watering treatment were
set as fixed effects. Because we hypothesised that the nurse effect on
beneficiary communities was modulated by water stress level and the richness of
the beneficiary communities, we included the two-way and three-way interactions.

We further accounted for the following sources of variation via additional fixed
effects: species identity of the beneficiary communities, time in months since
the start of the experiment, and terrace identity. We added an extra quadratic
effect of time as a fixed effect in the biomass model as it was found to
decrease after summer. We further accounted for pseudoreplication linked to repeated measurements of
the same beneficiary community across time by considering microsite level
variation (i.e. hole containing the beneficiary communities nested within the
terrace level) by specifying a random effect with these terms (Table S3).

All models were fit using a Bayesian framework. We fit the biomass response
variable with a gaussian error structure and the survival response variable with
a binomial one with a logit link function. We used the Integrated Nested
Laplacian Approximation (INLA)  to fit models [@rue_approximate_2009;
@rue_bayesian_2017] based on the INLA R package [@rue_approximate_2009], with
default uninformative priors. The prior distribution of fixed coefficients
followed a flat, zero centred, normal distribution ($\mathcal{N}(\mu,\,
\sigma^2) = \mathcal{N}(0,\, 1000)$). The prior distribution of the random
effects and the gaussian error followed a log gamma distribution with shape and
inverse scale parameters ($\mathcal{G}(s, \, \tau) = \mathcal{G}(1, \,
5.10^-5)$). We then back-transformed the estimated coefficients to the
standard deviations attributed to the random effects and the gaussian error
($\sigma = 1 / \sqrt{\tau}$). We computed the credible intervals for each model
parameters at 80%, 90% and 95% using the Highest Posterior Density method
[@hyndman_computing_1996], which can respectively be interpreted as weak,
moderate and strong evidence of an effect when the interval does not include 0
[@mastrandrea_guidance_2010; @van_klink_meta-analysis_2020].

We checked the overall quality of the model fit to the data visually by plotting
the fitted versus the observed values (Fig. S4, Table S4). We visually inspected the PIT
and CPO (respectively Posterior Integral Transform and Conditional Predictive
Ordinate) distribution to assess both the quality of data representation, and
the frequency of outliers.


### Estimates of nurse net effects on survival and biomass of beneficiary communities {-}

We used the statistical models above to obtain a prediction of plant biomass and
survival probability through time for all treatments, that we used to compute
summary indices of interactions. The net effect of the nurse-beneficiary
interactions was estimated with the Neighbor-effect Intensity index [NInt,
@diaz-sierra_new_2016]. Positive values indicate positive net effects of the
nurse on beneficiary communities (i.e. facilitation) while negative values
indicate net negative effects of the nurse (i.e. competition).
We used this index instead of the more-commonly used RII as the NInt displays
additive symmetric, i.e. positive and negative effects of the same magnitude are
captured by opposite values (e.g. +10/-10) while RII displays multiplicative
symmetry that leads to underestimation of facilitation compared to competition
[@diaz-sierra_new_2016]. The NInt is computed as follows:

\begin{equation}
    NInt_A = 2 \frac{ \Delta P }{P_{-N} + |\Delta P|}
    (\#eq:int)
\end{equation}

with ($P_{-N}$) the performance of the beneficiary species in open microsites and ($\Delta P$) the
difference between the performance of beneficiary species in nurse patches and
in open microsites (i.e. $P_{+N} - P_{-N}$). We used the sampled distribution of predicted
values of survival and biomass (N = 1000 sampling) to compute the mean and the
credible intervals at 80% of the Nint index.

### Nurse effects on the functional traits of beneficiary species

Using the same statistical models as above (i.e. fixed effect of water
treatment, presence/absence of nurse and species richness of beneficiary
communities, along with their interactions), we assessed the effects of
experimental treatments on both LDMC and SLA. These models did not include time
as a fixed effect as functional traits were measured only once.

### Nurse effects on complementarity and competitive hierarchy in beneficiary communities

We estimated how experimental treatments affect net diversity effects on
beneficiary biomass and its partition into complementarity and selection. We
used the same statistical model as for biomass added to an interaction between
species effect and experimental treatments in order to estimate the differential
responses of species to treatments, which is key to accurately estimate
selection effects. We used the predictions of biomass of the model to estimate
how nurse affects complementarity and competitive hierarchy (i.e. selection
effects) in beneficiary communities [@loreau_partitioning_2001].  The
complementarity effect measures if species in diverse communities have higher or
lower biomass than expected from monoculture. A negative complementarity effect
reflects a prevalence of competitive interference in beneficiary communities,
while positive values indicate the prevalence of resource use partitioning or
facilitation among beneficiary species. Selection effects assess changes in
species dominance in the beneficiary communities. Positive selection effects
indicate that species that have the highest performance (here, measured as
biomass) in monoculture are the ones that have the highest relative gain in
biomass in mixture and reversely, meaning that the species that produce the most
biomass in monoculture are the competitively dominant. Negative selection
effects indicate that species that have the highest biomass in monoculture have
also the lowest biomass gain in diverse communities, meaning that the species
that are the most productive in monoculture are poor competitors
[@fargione_selection_2007]. Finally neutral selection effects reflect that there
were no relationships between species performance in monoculture and in mixture,
indicating the absence of competitive dominance. Selection effects were computed
as the species richness (i.e. 3) times the covariance between the species
relative biomass change from monoculture to mixture and the species biomass in
monoculture. Complementarity effects are computed as the species richness times
the average species relative biomass change from monoculture to mixture times
the average species biomass in monoculture. As for Nint computation, we used
biomass prediction from the statistical model to compute the diversity net
effects and their 80% credible intervals.

## Effects of the nurse on the survival and biomass of beneficiary communities


We found no effect of the presence of the nurse alone on the survival and
biomass of monospecific beneficiary communities (survival odd-ratio = `r s_m`,
Fig. \@ref(fig:sbm)a; biomass: $\beta$ = `r b_m`, Fig. \@ref(fig:sbm)b),
resulting in an overall slight negative net effect of the nurse in monospecific
beneficiary communities (Fig. 2c, d, red and blue points).

We further found that, in open microsites, the species in diverse beneficiary communities had
the same survival (OR = `r s_c`, Fig. \@ref(fig:sbm)a) but lower biomass
($\beta$ = `r b_c`, Fig. \@ref(fig:sbm)b) than monospecific communities.
Watering increased the survival and biomass of beneficiary communities in open
microsites (survival: OR = `r s_w`, biomass: $\beta$ = `r b_w`), and this effect
was enhanced in diverse beneficiary communities (survival: OR = `r s_wc`,
biomass: $\beta$ = `r b_wc`). The positive watering effect on survival and
biomass in monospecific beneficiary communities was similar regardless of the
presence or absence of the nurse (survival: OR = `r s_wm`, biomass: $\beta$ =
`r b_wm`), resulting in near-neutral net effects of the nurse on monospecific
beneficiary communities in watered and non-watered treatments (Fig. \@ref(fig:sbm)c & d, red and
blue points).

Diverse beneficiary communities under nurses had higher survival and biomass
than monospecific beneficiary communities in the same conditions (strong support
for survival, OR = `r s_cm`, Fig. \@ref(fig:sbm)a, and weak support for biomass
$\beta$ = `r b_cm`, Fig. \@ref(fig:sbm)b), resulting in a strong positive net effect
of the nurse in diverse and non watered assemblages (Fig. 2 c & d, red
triangle). However, the positive effects of nurses on the survival and the
biomass of diverse beneficiary communities were reduced by  watering (survival:
OR = `r s_wcm`, Fig. \@ref(fig:sbm)a; biomass: $\beta$ = `r b_wcm`, Fig.
\@ref(fig:sbm)b), resulting in a negative net effect of the nurse in diverse and
watered beneficiary communities (Fig. \@ref(fig:sbm)c & d, blue triangle).

## Effect of the nurse on the traits of the beneficiaries

We found that functional traits of the beneficiary
communities responded similarly to the nurses and watering treatments (nurse and water alone in Fig.
3a). The Leaf Dry Matter Content (LDMC) and Specific Leaf Area (SLA) of the
beneficiary communities were found to respond to nurse patch and watering
treatments. We found that beneficiary communities located under nurses had a
higher SLA and lower LDMC than in open areas (Standardised coefficients:
$\beta$ = `r l_m` and `r a_m` respectively, Fig. \@ref(fig:lt)a). We further
found strong evidence for lower LDMC in watered treatment ($\beta$ = `r l_w`)
but not SLA ($\beta$ = `r a_w`). We did not find evidence that community
diversity affected leaf traits (Fig. \@ref(fig:lt)a).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
tar_read(env_inla_pred) %>%

```


We found that soil moisture was quite low, 7.25% on average in March and that
watering increased soil moisture by 4.24% 16 hours after watering (i.e. +58% in
March, Fig. S1, Table S1). However, nurse patches were not found to result in
higher soil moisture overall (4.0 95%CI:[3.1, 4.9] in nurse patch vs 4.0 [3.1,
4.9] in open non-watered microsites in June, Fig. S1). We found that nurse patches had a
temperature 3 celsius degrees lower than in the open at noon (32.3 [31.2, 33.5]
vs 28.9
[27.6, 30.1] in June, i.e. -11%, Fig. S1), and a Photosynthetic Active
Radiation 100 Quantum.m^-2.s^-1 lower than in the open (255 [229, 280] vs 358
[333, 383] in June, i.e. -29%, Fig. S1).

## Effects of the nurse on complementarity and competitive hierarchy

Partitioning the effects of species richness on the biomass of beneficiary
communities, we found that the presence of the nurse interacted with water
stress level to determine complementarity and selection effects (Fig. 3b). We
always found positive net effects of species diversity on beneficiary biomass,
driven by positive complementarity effects, contrasting with overall low
selection effects. Without watering, complementarity
increased under nurses compared to open microsites (Fig. 3b, red lines),
indicating that the nurse promotes the positive effects of species richness.
Conversely, with watering, increase in complementarity was higher in open
microsites than under nurse patches. In open microsites, the increase in
complementarity effects was much larger for watered beneficiary communities than
for non-watered ones (Fig. 3b, rounded points), while watering hardly increased
complementarity in nurse patches (Fig. 3b, triangular points). We further found
that watering increased selection effects from slightly negative to slightly
positive in open microsites (-.25 vs .5,Fig. 3b, rounded points), while watering
had no effect on selection in nurse patches (triangle points). In nurse patches,
selection effects were negative regardless of the water stress conditions
(around -.1, Fig. 3b), indicating that nurse plants altered competitive
dominance in beneficiary communities.

# Discussion {-}

One of the key questions about the role of facilitation buffering the impacts of
drought and climate change in dryland communities is how the species diversity
of beneficiary communities mediates facilitation and its effects.  We examined
the role of beneficiary species diversity with a manipulative field experiment
that allowed us to ask three key questions: 1) How does species richness affect
nurse net effects on survival and biomass? 2) How do nurse plants alter the
water stress of beneficiary communities?, and 3) How do nurse plants affect
complementarity and competitive hierarchy in beneficiary communities? Overall, we
found that nurse facilitation only occurred in case of species diverse
beneficiary communities and in the absence of watering. Nurse and watering
treatments had similar effects on complementarity (gain in biomass in
diverse beneficiary communities compared to monoculture) and on the traits of
beneficiaries. However, the nurse treatment differed from watering in its effect
on competitive hierarchy, as nurse maintained quasi-neutral selection effects. Here
we review our results in the wider context of global change research in drylands
and previous work on facilitation and ecological theory.


## Species richness and water stress determine nurse effects on survival and biomass of beneficiary communities

We found that nurses had weak and quasi-neutral net effects on the survival and
biomass of monospecific beneficiary communities, regardless of the level of
water stress. This result could be explained by a
strong intraspecific competition among the 3 beneficiary individuals in
monoculture that swamps the positive effects of the presence of the nurse. Those results are in line
with the meta-analysis reporting that intraspecific competition is several orders
of magnitude higher than interspecific competition [@adler_competition_2018].
This is also aligned with coexistence theory that predicts strong competition
among conspecific plants due to the absence of niche differences
[@chesson_general_2000; @kraft_plant_2015], and this effect appeared to
supersede the effect of nursing, regardless of the water treatment. Our results
suggest that accounting for competition among beneficiary species is one
important factor to understand the effects of nursing on beneficiary communities
[@schob_direct_2013; @michalet_disentangling_2015].


In contrast with monospecific beneficiary communities, we found that the nurse
had strong positive effects on plant survival and biomass in diverse beneficiary
communities in unwatered conditions. This positive effect of nursing in mixture
in absence of watering could then be held by the lower competition experienced
by the beneficiary species in the mixture communities, thereby the facilitation
provided by the nurse exceeds the competition among beneficiary species. It
resonates with coexistence theory stating that niche differentiation is key to
achieve stable coexistence [@chesson_general_2000]. However, the positive effect
of the nurse in mixture shifted to a negative effect in watered conditions, in
accordance with the numerous studies showing that nurse-beneficiary net
interactions shift from positive in stressful environments to negative in more
benign environments [@bertness_positive_1994; @callaway_positive_2007;
@graff_species_2017]. This shift toward a negative effect of the nurse could be
held by two processes: watering improved the performance of beneficiaries in
open microsites, but nurses were more efficient than beneficiary plants in
consuming the added water in patch microsites through a more developed rooting
system [@aguiar_competition_1994; @maestre_positive_2003]. Many dryland species quickly respond to
water pulses, yet the differences in size and associated capacity for water
uptake between an adult nurse plant and its neighbour saplings could explain
that watering primarily benefited the nurse plant [@morcillo_interacting_2022],
even resulting, as in our study, in negative net effects between the nurse and
beneficiary communities.


## Effects of nurse on functional traits

We found that beneficiary communities followed less resource-conservative
strategy (or a more resource-exploitative strategy) when being watered or in a
nurse patch than when being not watered or in open sites. More specifically, we
found that the LDMC of beneficiary communities decreased in watered microsites
and in nurse patch microsites. At a broader scale, LDMC has been found to
decrease  with increasing annual rainfall [@borgy_plant_2017]. Our results
suggest that we can draw a parallel between the effects of being under a nurse
and the increase in water resources, could be both related to lower water
deficit. We further found an increase in the Specific Leaf Area of beneficiary
communities in nurse patch sites, which might indicate as well the development
of a less resource conservative strategy in nurse patches
[@galmes_modulation_2005; @zhang_mechanisms_2015]. Another explanation is that
decrease in LDMC and increase in SLA in nurse patches might be due to the
shading effect of the nurse. Indeed, light reduction and shading can induce a
compensation for the limited amount of radiation received and a common
adaptation for understory plants [@pons_ecophysiological_1977;
@ackerly_leaf_2002; @liu_does_2016; @yang_effects_2019]. We did not find that
watering affects the SLA of beneficiary communities in open sites, but led to
lower LDMC. It suggests that the response of leaf traits to the decrease of
water stress in open sites did not imply leaf area, maybe because of the higher
evapotranspiration in open sites, which might in turn promote the maintenance of
the same specific leaf area (i.e. same SLA) despite less water stress. Overall,
our results are consistent with previous results showing that decrease in water
stress results in plant plastic responses toward higher SLA and lower LDMC
[@galmes_modulation_2005; @zhang_mechanisms_2015; @jung_intraspecific_2014, but
see @majekova_weak_2021]. However, the direct measurement of plant physiology
activity would be necessary to conclude more definitively on the link between
nurse presence, water stress and plant strategy. We did not find an effect of
the species richness of beneficiary communities on average LDMC and SLA.
It might be because functional traits are expected to respond to variations in
species richness in terms of trait variance and overlap [@violle_return_2012;
@danet_effects_2018] rather than in average values, which are expected to
respond to environmental changes as we found in the present study
[@enquist_scaling_2015; @danet_nurse_2017].

## Nurse increases complementarity effects in beneficiary communities

Our results also provide insights on how species richness effects were
partitioned in complementarity and selection effects. We found consistent net
positive effects of species richness on beneficiary community biomass, driven by
positive complementarity effects, contrasting with overall low selection
effects. Overall, diversity net effects associated with selection were very low
compared to complementarity effects, a result similar to previous findings in
grasslands [@loreau_partitioning_2001; @fargione_selection_2007]. It indicates
the positive effects of species richness on biomass are held by complementary
effects rather than selection, suggesting that the processes linked to niche
differentiation and facilitation play a more important role than the ones linked
to competitive dominance. We further found that
watering increased complementarity effects in open sites and that nurse
increased complementarity effects in no watered sites, indicating again that there
is a parallel between the effect in resource increase and nursing effects. We
further found that in watered sites, the nurse did not increase complementarity
effects in beneficiary communities compared to open sites, which can be related
with the negative net effects of nurse on biomass found in watered diverse
beneficiary communities.

However, we found that low water stress led to positive selection
effects in open sites (compared to quasi neutral selection effects at low water
stress level), i.e. that species that had higher biomass in monoculture had the
higher biomass in diverse beneficiary communities. This result indicates that
alleviation of water stress by watering results in the competitive dominance of
species that have the higher biomass in monoculture, while higher water stress
in control conditions suppresses this competitive dominance. It agrees with
previous findings showing that even small changes in environmental conditions
can result in a shift in the competitive hierarchy among species [@hillerislambers_how_2013;
@alexander_when_2016; @van_dyke_small_2022].
The negative selection effects found in nurse patches regardless of the
water stress indicate that species that had the lower biomass in monoculture had
the higher increase in biomass in mixture, suggesting that the more maladapted
species benefited the most from being in a nurse patch. It resonates with
earlier findings showing that nurse plants can change the competitive hierarchy
of beneficiary species [@schob_direct_2013; @michalet_disentangling_2015]
and that mal-adapted species are the most facilitated species
[@liancourt_stress_2005; @graff_species_2017]. Hence the use of nurse
plants, might be a key to maintain the positive effects of biodiversity on
ecosystem functioning by buffering  environmental stochasticity in environments
that in environments that are expected to experience more and more extreme
environmental variations [@jiang_importance_2008; @wright_overlooked_2017].

## Facilitation potential to mitigate climate change effects on biodiversity

Our results show that the facilitation provided by nurse plants can improve the
performance of species diverse beneficiary communities in water stress condition
by increasing biomass and survival, lead to changes in leaf functional traits
toward less water stress syndrome, increase the complementarity effects (i.e.
niche differentiation and facilitation) in beneficiary communities while
facilitating more the most maladapted species (i.e. negative selection effects)
of species regardless of the water stress. Furthermore, our results show that
the nurse effect is similar to the effect of adding water to open sites (on
functional traits and complementarity effects). Altogether, the results suggest
that facilitation by nurse shrubs can promote diversity of beneficiary
communities under high water deficit by increasing survival, which points to its
importance to maintaining biodiversity in a climate change context. Secondly,
our study also suggests that nurse shrubs can promote the species richness
effects on biomass production. The potential of using facilitation as a
potential restoration tool in drylands largely depends on the nurse and the
beneficiary target species [@fagundes_nurse-target_2022]. However,
according to our results, facilitation by nurse shrubs could help to establish
species-rich transplanted communities by increasing the potential for niche
differentiation and facilitation among beneficiary species. However, if nurses
come to be impacted by climate change and/or targeted by land-use change, then
we could expect dramatic cascading effects in drylands communities
[@losapio_resistance_2017].


# Conclusion and perspectives

Our study suffers from some limits that might impede its generalisability. Here,
diverse beneficiary communities were only composed of three species, which is a
relatively low number of species compared to natural dryland communities, and we
used a nurse plant, *Artemisia herba-alba*, which is known to produce phytotoxic
compounds [@arroyo_phytotoxic_2018]; different results might be expected with a less
inhibitory nurse plants. Another limit of our experiment is that it only lasts
for one year because most saplings have died after the first summer. Therefore,
predictions of nursing effects over a longer time are difficult to estimate,
such as longer time scales might change effects of the nurse on complementarity
and selection effects in beneficiary communities [@fargione_selection_2007]. However,
our study reports a major role of the species richness of the  beneficiary
communities in driving nurse net effects on survival and biomass. It indicates
that facilitation of beneficiary communities are more likely to happen to
species diverse communities. Furthermore, our study shows that facilitation can
maintain high complementarity effects and low selection effects despite water
stress. Then, our study opens new perspectives on how facilitation acts on
species diverse communities and contributes to integrate facilitation more
explicitly into biodiversity and ecosystem functioning concepts.
