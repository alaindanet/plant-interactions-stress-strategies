# Abstract {-}

Climate change is expected to lead to a drier world, with more frequent and
severe droughts, constituting a growing threat to biodiversity, especially in
drylands. Positive plant-plant interactions, such as nurse plants facilitating
beneficiary communities in their understorey, could mitigate such
climate-induced stress. However, testing the real-world relevance of nurse
facilitation under drought requires accounting for interactions within the
diverse beneficiary communities, which may reduce, or amplify the buffering
effect of a nurse. Here, we investigated the when and how the interactions among
nurse plants and beneficiary community members buffered drought effects in a
Mediterranean semiarid abandoned cropland. We transplanted sapling beneficiary
communities of either one or three species either under a nurse or in open
microsites for different soil moisture levels through watering. Net facilitative
effects on survival and biomass were only observed when beneficiary communities
were species-diverse and under drought (without watering), meaning that under
these conditions, facilitation provided by the nurse had larger positive effects
than the negative effects stemming from competition with the nurse and among
beneficiary species. Nurses appear to be generating these increases in survival
and biomass in drought conditions via two mechanisms commonly associated with
watering in open sites: they generate complementarity among the beneficiaries
and shift traits to low stress profiles. Contrasting with watering, which was
found to enhance competitive hierarchy, our study shows that nurses appear to
alter species dominance, favouring the less competitive species. Our results
highlight three mechanisms (complementarity, competitive dominance, and trait
plasticity) by which nurse species could mitigate the loss of biodiversity and
biomass production due to water stress. Maintaining and supporting nurse species
is thus a potentially pivotal approach in the face of projected increase in
drought conditions for many drylands across the world.

# Introduction {-}

Climate change has already led to a rise in the frequency of extreme heat and
drought events, a trend observed globally over recent decades and projected to
persist [@lee_ipcc_2023]. Such conditions have direct detrimental effects
on plants, especially those not adapted to prolonged and frequent periods of
water stress, and will likely alter ecosystem structure and functioning in the
long term [@muller_drought_2022]. The changes to ecosystem structure and
functioning will certainly arise in part to do changes in plant-plant
interactions and plant coexistence [@alexander_when_2016; @graff_species_2017].
However, plant-plant interactions may also modulate the level of water stress
experienced by plants [@maestre_positive_2003], potentially buffering the
impacts of increasingly drier conditions [@morcillo_functional_2019]. A key
example of such buffering arises from the hypothesised positive impacts of nurse
plants [@callaway_positive_2007]. Improving our understanding of how species
interactions both respond to and shape responses to drought  is critical to
predict the future of plant communities in a drier world.

Drylands across the planet exhibit limited water availability for plants and
animals. In drylands, plants referred to as "benefactors" or "nurses" that
facilitate other plants (“beneficiaries”) are key drivers of community structure
and functioning [@anthelme_positive_2007; @michalet_biotic_2006;
@maestre_structure_2016]. Nurse plants can improve environmental conditions beneath
their canopy, e.g. by reducing soil erosion, buffering the daily fluctuations in
temperature, and increasing water retention [@callaway_positive_2007]. Such positive
effects relative to drought conditions correlate with increased species richness
[@gross_positive_2008; @cavieres_facilitative_2014], increased diversity in community composition
[@kikvidze_effects_2015], and underpin large scale ecosystem properties such as
productivity [@cardinale_species_2002; @wright_overlooked_2017],
resilience [@kefi_local_2007; @kefi_spatial_2007] and the spatial distribution
of species in drylands. Nurse plants, by generating these local environmental
conditions, could thus mitigate the effects of increasing severity and frequency
of drought events on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.

However, in order to accurately assess the potential of facilitative effects for
mitigating the effects of climate change (e.g. droughts, extreme temperatures),
one must evaluate nurse effects in biodiverse communities and disentangle the
multiple mechanisms by which they operate and
contexts in which they arise. We propose three key mechanisms to monitor that
arise from trait-based ecology and ecosystem functioning research
[@loreau_partitioning_2001]: complementarity effects (i.e. niche differentiation
and facilitation), competitive hierarchy (i.e. selection effects), and
plasticity (i.e. trait profile changes). There are independent pieces of
evidence for all three of these, which we review below before introducing our
experiment and data that address all three simultaneously.

Community assembly theory, and specifically the concepts of complementarity and
competitive hierarchy, provides key predictions about the outcome of
nurse-beneficiary interactions in species-diverse communities. Facilitation can
be seen as an expansion of the niche of beneficiary species
[@bruno_inclusion_2003; @koffel_competition_2021], e.g. by making environmental
conditions suitable for a larger range of species, such as those
that prefer higher moisture. Furthermore, at the microsite scale, nurse plants
increase habitat heterogeneity, further extending the niche space available to
beneficiary plants for beneficiary plants [@obrien_shift_2017]. This expanded
niche space is likely better exploited by species-rich beneficiary communities
that are able to use different aspects of this new resource space, e.g. by
having contrasted water use strategies, i.e. higher ‘niche complementarity’
[@cardinale_species_2002; @loreau_partitioning_2001], or in cases where
beneficiaries directly facilitate each other. Previous research identified that
facilitation from nurse plants benefits more the least drought resistant species
[@liancourt_stress_2005; @graff_species_2017], and that nurses
can alter competitive hierarchy among beneficiary species
[@schob_direct_2013;@michalet_direct_2017], which are coined as “selection
effects” [@loreau_partitioning_2001]. Previous studies reported that
species richness increases complementarity but have contrasting effects on
selection [@loreau_partitioning_2001;@fargione_selection_2007], such as
complementarity effects are responsible for the positive effects of species
richness on grassland productivity. Investigating how nurse-provided
facilitation affects complementarity (i.e. niche differentiation and
facilitation) and selection (i.e. competitive hierarchy) in beneficiary
communities can thus bridge the gap between facilitation and ecosystem
functioning research [@wright_overlooked_2017].

By modifying local environmental conditions, nurse plants may also  alter the
physiology and resource exploitation strategies of the beneficiary plants via
phenotypic plasticity or evolution. The physiological response to variation in environmental
conditions can be assessed by using leaf functional traits, such as a lower Leaf
Dry Matter Content (LDMC) and a higher Specific Leaf Area (SLA) can indicate a
decrease of water stress [@galmes_modulation_2005; @zhang_mechanisms_2015;
@majekova_weak_2021]. In harsh environments, previous research identified that
beneficiary species located beneath and within
a nurse display higher variability in leaf trait composition, but also
less-stressed leaf trait syndromes than beneficiary species located in open
sites [@schob_foundation_2012; @schob_direct_2013; @schob_trait-based_2017;
@danet_nurse_2017; @danet_effects_2018]. Accounting for how the presence of
the nurse and water stress modulate values of functional traits is therefore a
valuable way to further understand the mechanisms by which facilitation operates
on beneficiary plants.

Here we report on an in situ experiment set in a semiarid dryland experiencing a
long and severe drought (Standard Precipitation Evaporation Index < -1.5 SD over
the study period, Fig. S1) and designed to test how facilitative
effects provided by nurse species in drylands differed for
diverse and monospecific beneficiary communities, and how these
facilitative effects changed under lower water stress. Our experiment allows
us to gather data about the relative importance of complementarity, competitive
hierarchy and trait plasticity in shaping patterns of facilitation. To do so, we
performed a fully factorial experiment crossing beneficiary species diversity
(three species in monoculture and three species communities), presence
and absence of nurse species (nurse patch vs. open) and water stress (watered vs
non-watered). Specifically, with this design, we ask the following 4 questions.
1) How does species richness of beneficiary communities affect nurse net effects
on the survival and biomass of those beneficiary communities? 2) How do nurse
plants and water stress interact in driving the response of the beneficiary
communities? 3) How do nurse plants affect complementarity and competitive
hierarchy in beneficiary communities? 4) How do nurse plants alter the
functional traits of beneficiary communities?

## Study area {-}


The experiment was conducted in 2016 in the Murcia region, Southeastern Spain
(37°57’33“N, 1°00’17”W – 172 m a.s.l., Fig. \@ref(fig:exp)a). The region’s climate is semiarid
Mediterranean with a very high year to year variability. Mean annual rainfall is
283mm and mean annual temperature is 18.2°C [Murcia Meteorological Station,
period 1960-2017, @paniagua_aridity_2019]. The experiment was conducted in 2016,
within a long drought period in the region that was particularly severe for the
water years 2013-2016, which received 543.5mm of total rainfall (64% of the
long-term average, i.e. 100mm less per year than average) and experienced a mean
annual temperature of 20°C, almost 2 °C above the long-term average
(Meteorological State Agency, AEMET). The Standardised Precipitation
Evapotranspiration Index [SPEI, @vicente-serrano_multiscalar_2010], a proxy for
water balance, was during the experiment 1.5 standard deviations lower than the
average over the 1950-2023 period in the region (Fig. S1), which can be
categorised as severely drought conditions [@slette_how_2019]. Soils are thin (20-50 cm),
of silt-loam type (32% sand, 47% silt, 21% clay), and basic (pH = 8.7). The area
is a mosaic of moderately steep slopes covered by alpha-grass (*Stipa
tenacissima*) steppes and abandoned agricultural terraces built on the
streambeds. The agricultural terraces in the study site were abandoned in the
80s and 90s and progressively colonised by forbs and shrubs (Fig.
\@ref(fig:exp)b). The extant perennial vegetation is dominated by the shrubs
*Artemisia herba-alba*, *Anthyllis cytisoides* and *Pistacia lentiscus*.

## Experimental design {-}

To assess the nursing effects on beneficiary communities, we set the beneficiary
communities either under the canopy of a nurse plant, *Artemisia herba-alba*, or
in open microsites. *A. herba-alba* is a pioneer and common non-palatable species
in drylands, known for extending its grazing protection toward palatable plants
[@alados_association_2006; @verwijmeren_drought_2014;
@verwijmeren_combined_2019]. *A. herba-alba* was also reported to increase soil
moisture after high rainfall events but to decrease it after small rain events
[@verwijmeren_combined_2019]. Furthermore, a closely related species Artemisia tridendata
was previously shown to positively alter microclimate
[@callaway_competition_1996; @ryel_rapid_2003]. It was reported to be partially
phytotoxic, producing strong anti-germination compounds affecting both its own
and other species, which however were not reported to affect negatively sapling
growth [@arroyo_phytotoxic_2018].

To assess how nurse effects varied with the species richness of the beneficiary
communities, we transplanted three plants under the nurse and in open microsites
either one beneficiary species growing in monoculture, or a mix of three species
(Fig. \@ref(fig:exp)c). We selected three different beneficiary species, so we
had 4 different understorey community types in total (3 monocultures and 1
mixture). We selected three common shrub species of the Mediterranean steppes as
beneficiary species, namely *Anthyllis cytisoides*, *Dorycnium pentaphyllum* and
*Pistacia lentiscus*, which are commonly found to co-occur in the same
communities [@amat_community_2015]. Saplings of those three species were already
reported growing under other shrub species in the region
[@maestre_mechanisms_2004; @sanchez-martin_interspecific_2023]. All those
species have characteristics that are considered to be adaptations to the
semi-arid climates. *Anthyllis cytisoides* is a drought-avoider and sheds its
leaves during summer, thereby decreasing the transpiring area
[@haase_photosynthetic_2000]. *Pistacia lentiscus* is a late successional
evergreen shrub which can develop a dense root system at the sapling stage
within one year after transplantation [@maestre_positive_2003]. It can also
increase the water storage in its leaves during the hot and dry season
[@maestre_mechanisms_2004], and the thick cuticle of its leaves
[@coste_flore_1937] limits the loss of water by evapotranspiration. *Dorycnium
pentaphyllum* is a low-growing species known for its resistance to water stress
[@caravaca_use_2003]. Its pinnate leaves, divided into narrow leaflets, decrease
the transpiration surface and allow a more efficient regulation of the
transpiration rate [@vogel_leaves_2009].

To assess how the level of water stress interacted with the nurse effects on
beneficiary communities, we manipulated soil moisture by supplementing
beneficiary communities with 1.5L of water per planting microsite and compared
with control (not watered) beneficiary communities. Because of the
naturally-droughted ambient conditions we treat the 'not-watered' treatment as
water-stressed conditions and the 'watered' treatment as non-water-stressed
conditions. This naturally-droughted approach overcomes the potential
limitations and artefacts associated with experimentally induced drought [e.g.,
@kreyling_drought_2017; @kroel-dulay_field_2022]. We watered the planting
microsites 8 times during 2016 around 6pm to avoid the strongest
evapotranspiration, once a month in spring and summer (i.e. March, April, May,
June, July, and August) and every two months otherwise (i.e. January and
October). We did so by emptying one water bottle per microsite. We measured soil
moisture 16 hours after watering in January and June using a hand-held TDR
sensor (Fig. S2).

We used a fully factorial design that included 3 treatments with two levels
each: microsite (nurse patch/ open), assemblage diversity (monospecific /
diverse), and watering (yes / no), with three types of monospecific assemblages,
one per each target beneficiary species, resulting in 16 combinations of
treatments and assemblages, each of them replicated 20 times. The treatment
combinations were distributed among 3 terraces so that treatments were
replicated 6 to 7 times per terrace. Because of the abundance of grazers in the
area (mainly rabbits), every terrace was fenced with 1.80 metres height wire
fences and reinforced by chicken wire extending from about 60 cm above ground to
20 cm below ground.


## Experimental setting and measurements

r2bm <- setNames(round(unlist(biomass_modelling_r2[1,][c(2, 3)]), 2), c("R2", "adj"))
```

The transplantation of beneficiary communities was done between October 23 and
November 4, 2015, into planting holes (beforehand and hereafter named
“microsite”, Fig. \@ref(fig:exp)) of approximately 25×25×25 cm dug manually. Each hole
received one beneficiary community. The holes benefiting from the nurse plant
effect (hereafter named “nurse patch”) were located below the canopy of the
benefactor, about 20 cm apart from the main stem of the plant, and oriented
northward to maximise the shading effect. We selected mature nurse plants, which
were relatively homogeneous in canopy size. When a nurse was part of a patch, we
located the microsite such that mainly one plant influenced it. Each nurse
received one hole only (i.e. one beneficiary community). One week before
planting saplings, the area received about 40 mm of natural rainfall (affecting
all terraces equally), which provided excellent initial moisture conditions for
the planted saplings. The holes were randomly attributed to the different
treatments. The saplings composing the beneficiary communities were about 6
months at the time of transplantation and were grown from a local seed bank in the open air in a
nursery (Viveros Muzalé S.L., www.viverosmuzale.com). They were grown in controlled wet conditions in 200 ml containers with a
mixture of peat and coconut fibre, containing several individuals of the same
species. Plants were bought in small pots. Each hole received one beneficiary
community of three plants. We planted three pots per hole, following a
triangular arrangement in which the plant pots were equally distant from each
other (approximately 10 cm). To exclude the initial variation in the number of
individuals per microsite, we only considered holes in which at least one
individual from the original container survived in January, and removed
supernumerary individuals by cutting their stems at their basis.

In order to estimate the total biomass of the beneficiary plants during the
experiment, we estimated the allometric relationship linking total biomass to
basal diameter and maximal height with a species effect
[@catchpole_estimating_1992; @nafus_multispecies_2009]. We put aside twelve
individuals of each species in November (i.e. at the time we collected the
seedlings from the nursery), and dried them at 65°C for three days to assess the
total biomass of each individual. We log-transformed total biomass, basal
diameter and vegetative height prior to modelling. The R² of the model was quite
high ($R^2$ = `r r2bm["R2"]`, adjusted $R^2$ = `r r2bm["adj"]`), and we found a
good agreement between predicted and observed values (Fig. S3, see estimated
coefficients in Table S2). This allometric relationship provided an estimation
of total plant biomass based on the non-lethal measurement of plant height and
stem diameter in the field (considering either only basal diameter or estimated
total biomass did not alter our conclusions, see Fig. S4). Basal diameter was
measured using a digital caliper at around 1 cm above the ground. To increase
accuracy of the repeated measurements on the same plant, (1) we left a mark at
the exact place where the first basal diameter measurement was taken and (2)
measurements were done on the same side of the stem. Maximum height was measured
using a measuring tape as the vertical distance between the soil and the top
leafed stem. During the experiment, we measured the performance of individual
beneficiary plants by recording (1) their survival and (2) their total biomass
(using the above allometric relationship) from January to October 2016 (10
months).

To better understand the underlying mechanism through which nurse plants affect
the beneficiary communities, we analysed how  leaf functional traits responded
to experimental treatments among beneficiaries. We focused on two leaf traits
known to reflect different resource acquisition strategies: Leaf Dry Matter
Content (LDMC) and Specific Leaf Area [SLA, @perez-harguindeguy_new_2013]. The
leaves of beneficiary plants were collected and processed in March 2016 (4
months after plantation) following guidelines from @perez-harguindeguy_new_2013.
We only collected leaves without traces of disease, grazing or senescence, that
were mature and most exposed to sunlight (i.e. close to the top
of the main stem). We collected a few numbers of leaves, and only from the most
healthy individuals, as to minimise the effect of leaf sampling on their
response to experimental conditions. We collected 3 leaves per plant for *P.
lentiscus*, 5 leaves for *A. citisoides* and 10 leaves for *D. pentaphyllum*, so that
the overall dry leaf biomass of each sample was sufficient for weighing. Leaves
from each individual were stored in a plastic tube with a humid tissue to limit
desiccation and stored in thermally-isolated cooler for transportation. Leaves
were then first rehydrated with deionised water for several minutes, weighed,
scanned, and then dried at least 48h at 72°C. Once dry, we weighed individual
leaves to compute LDMC and SLA. We a priori selected a random subset of
microsites to be sampled, and then we effectively sampled only the subset that
met the above conditions to reach a minimal sampling size per treatment
combination of 7 samples for SLA (max 36) and 13 samples for LDMC (max 75, Table
S3).

## Data analysis {-}

Data analyses comprised two steps. We first modelled the survival, the biomass,
and the leaf functional traits of the beneficiary communities to assess the
effects of experimental treatments. We then used the predicted values of
survival and biomass to compute the net effects of the nurse on beneficiary
communities, and used the predicted values of biomass to compute complementarity
and selection effects.

### Modelling survival and biomass of beneficiary communities {-}


We used mixed-effect generalised linear models to test whether the presence of
the nurse affected the performance of beneficiary communities, i.e. their total
biomass and their survival, for different levels of species richness
(monoculture or mix of three species) and water stress. The presence of the
nurse, the species richness of the beneficiary communities and the watering
treatment were set as fixed effects. Because we hypothesised that the nurse
effect on beneficiary communities was modulated by water stress level and the
richness of the beneficiary communities, we included the two-way and three-way
interactions.

We further accounted for the following sources of variation via additional fixed
effects: species identity of the beneficiary communities, time in months since
the start of the experiment, and terrace identity. We added an extra quadratic
effect of time as a fixed effect in the biomass model as it was found to
decrease after summer. We further accounted for pseudoreplication linked to
repeated measurements of the same beneficiary community across time by
considering microsite level variation (i.e. hole containing the beneficiary
communities nested within the terrace level) by specifying a random effect with
these terms (Table S4).

All models were fit using a Bayesian framework. We fit the biomass response
variable with a gaussian error structure and the survival response variable with
a binomial one with a logit link function. We used the Integrated Nested
Laplacian Approximation (INLA) to fit models [@rue_approximate_2009;
@rue_bayesian_2017] based on the INLA R package [@rue_approximate_2009], with
default uninformative priors. The prior distribution of fixed coefficients
followed a flat, zero centred, normal distribution ($\mathcal{N}(\mu,\,
\sigma^2) = \mathcal{N}(0,\, 1000)$). The prior distribution of the random
effects and the gaussian error followed a log gamma distribution with shape and
inverse scale parameters ($\mathcal{G}(s, \, \tau) = \mathcal{G}(1, \,
5.10^-5)$). We then back-transformed the estimated coefficients to the standard
deviations attributed to the random effects and the gaussian error ($\sigma = 1
/ \sqrt{\tau}$). We computed the credible intervals for each model parameters at
80%, 90% and 95% using the Highest Posterior Density method
[@hyndman_computing_1996], which can respectively be interpreted as weak,
moderate and strong evidence of an effect when the interval does not include 0
[@mastrandrea_guidance_2010; @van_klink_meta-analysis_2020].

We checked the overall quality of the model fit to the data visually by plotting
the fitted versus the observed values (Fig. S5) and visually inspected the
aggrement between predicted and observed differences between treatments (Fig.
S6, S8, S9). The conditional $R^2$ of the models were of 0.37, 0.09, 0.66 for
biomass, LDMC, and SLA respectively (Table S5).

### Estimates of nurse net effects on survival and biomass of beneficiary communities {-}


We used the statistical models above to obtain a prediction of plant biomass and
survival probability through time for all treatments, which we used to compute
summary indices of interactions. The net effect of the nurse-beneficiary
interactions was estimated with the additive Neighbor-effect Intensity index
[NIntA, @diaz-sierra_new_2017]. Positive values indicate positive net effects
of the nurse on beneficiary communities (i.e. facilitation), while negative
values indicate net negative effects of the nurse (i.e. competition). We used
this index instead of the more-commonly used RII because the NIntA displays
additive symmetry, i.e. positive and negative effects of the same magnitude are
captured by opposite values (e.g. +10/-10), which avoids the underestimation of
facilitation compared to competition [@diaz-sierra_new_2017]. It contrasts with
the more-commonly used RII that displays multiplicative symmetry. The NIntA is
computed as follows:

\begin{equation}
    NInt_A = 2 \frac{ \Delta P }{P_{-N} + |\Delta P|}
    (\#eq:int)
\end{equation}

with ($P_{-N}$) the performance of the beneficiary species in open microsites
and ($\Delta P$) the difference between the performance of beneficiary species
in nurse patches and in open microsites (i.e. $P_{+N} - P_{-N}$). We used the
sampled distribution of predicted values of survival and biomass (N = 1000
sampling) to compute the mean and the credible intervals at 80% of the NintA
index.

### Nurse effects on the functional traits of beneficiary species


Using the same statistical models as above (i.e. fixed effect of water
treatment, presence/absence of nurse and species richness of beneficiary
communities, along with their interactions), we assessed the effects of
experimental treatments on both LDMC and SLA. These models did not include time
as a fixed effect as functional traits were measured only once.

### Nurse effects on complementarity and competitive hierarchy in beneficiary communities

We estimated how experimental treatments affected net diversity effects on
beneficiary biomass and its partition into complementarity and selection effects. We
used the same statistical model as for biomass, in which we added an interaction
term between species effect and experimental treatments in order to estimate the
differential responses of species to treatments, which is necessary to estimate
selection effects. We used the model predictions for biomass to estimate how
nurses alter complementarity and competitive hierarchy (i.e. selection effects)
in beneficiary communities [@loreau_partitioning_2001]. The complementarity effect
measures whether species in diverse communities have higher or lower biomass
than expected from monoculture. A negative complementarity effect reflects a
prevalence of competitive interference in beneficiary communities, while
positive values indicate the prevalence of resource use partitioning or
facilitation among beneficiary species. Complementarity effects were computed as
the species richness times the average species relative biomass change from
monoculture to mixture times the average species biomass in monoculture.
Selection effects assess changes in species dominance in the beneficiary
communities. Positive selection effects indicate that species that have the
highest performance (here, measured as biomass) in monoculture are the ones that
have the highest relative gain in biomass in mixture and reversely, meaning that
the species that produce the most biomass in monoculture are the competitively
dominant. Negative selection effects indicate that species that have the highest
biomass in monoculture also have the lowest biomass gain in diverse communities,
meaning that the species that are the most productive in monoculture are poor
competitors [@fargione_selection_2007]. Finally, neutral selection effects reflect
an absence of relationship between species performance in monoculture and in
mixture, indicating an absence of competitive dominance. Selection effects were
computed as the species richness (i.e. 3) times the covariance between the
species relative biomass change from monoculture to mixture and the species
biomass in monoculture. As for NIntA computation, we used the biomass predicted
from the statistical model to compute the diversity net effects, complementarity
and selection effects, along with their 80% credible intervals.

## Effects of the nurse on the survival and biomass of beneficiary communities


We found no effect of the presence of the nurse alone on the survival and
biomass of monospecific beneficiary communities (survival odd-ratio = `r s_m`,
Fig. \@ref(fig:sbm)a; biomass: $\beta$ = `r b_m`, Fig. \@ref(fig:sbm)b; CI:
Credible Interval),
resulting in an overall neutral net effect of the nurse in monospecific
beneficiary communities (Fig. \@ref(fig:sbm)c, d, red and blue points).

We further found that, in open microsites, the species in diverse beneficiary communities had
the same survival (OR = `r s_c`, Fig. \@ref(fig:sbm)a) but lower biomass
($\beta$ = `r b_c`, Fig. \@ref(fig:sbm)b) than monospecific communities.
Watering increased the survival and biomass of beneficiary communities in open
microsites (survival OR = `r s_w`, biomass: $\beta$ = `r b_w`), and this effect
was enhanced in diverse beneficiary communities (survival: OR = `r s_wc`,
biomass: $\beta$ = `r b_wc`). This translates into a watering effect that was of
+80% ((1.11 + 0.97)/1.11 - 1) in diverse communities than in monoculture. The
positive watering effect on survival and biomass in monospecific beneficiary
communities was similar regardless of the presence or absence of the nurse
(survival OR = `r s_wm`; biomass: $\beta$ = `r b_wm`), resulting in near-neutral
net effects of the nurse on monospecific beneficiary communities in watered and
non-watered treatments (Fig. \@ref(fig:sbm)c & d, red and blue points).

Diverse beneficiary communities under nurses had higher survival and biomass
than monospecific beneficiary communities in the same conditions (strong support
for survival, OR = `r s_cm`, Fig. \@ref(fig:sbm)a, and weaker support for biomass
$\beta$ = `r b_cm`, Fig. \@ref(fig:sbm)b), resulting in a strong positive net effect
of the nurse in diverse and non watered assemblages (Fig. \@ref(fig:sbm)c & d, red
triangle). However, the positive effects of nurses on the survival and the
biomass of diverse beneficiary communities were reduced by  watering (survival:
OR = `r s_wcm`, Fig. \@ref(fig:sbm)a; biomass: $\beta$ = `r b_wcm`, Fig.
\@ref(fig:sbm)b), resulting in a negative net effect of the nurse in diverse and
watered beneficiary communities (Fig. \@ref(fig:sbm)c & d, blue triangle).

## Effects of the nurse on complementarity and competitive hierarchy

Partitioning the effects of species richness on the biomass of beneficiary
communities, we found that the presence of the nurse interacted with water
stress level to determine complementarity and selection effects (Fig.
\@ref(fig:div)). We always found positive net effects of species diversity on
beneficiary biomass, driven by positive complementarity effects, while selection
effects were ten times lower in magnitude. Without watering, complementarity
increased under nurses compared to open microsites (Fig. \@ref(fig:div), red
lines), indicating that the nurse promotes the positive effects of species
richness. Conversely, with watering, increase in complementarity was higher in
open microsites than under nurse patches. In open microsites, the increase in
complementarity effects was much larger for watered beneficiary communities than
for non-watered ones (Fig. \@ref(fig:div), points), while watering hardly
increased complementarity in nurse patches (Fig. \@ref(fig:div), triangles). We
further found that watering increased selection effects from slightly negative
to slightly positive in open microsites (-.25 vs .5,Fig. \@ref(fig:div),
points), while watering had no effect on selection in nurse patches (triangles).
In nurse patches, selection effects were negative regardless of the water stress
conditions (around -.1, Fig. \@ref(fig:div)), indicating that nurse plants
altered competitive dominance in beneficiary communities.

## Effect of the nurse on trait plasticity

We found that functional traits of the beneficiary communities responded
similarly to the nurses and watering treatments (effects of nurse and water
alone on LDMC, Fig. \@ref(fig:lt)). The Leaf Dry Matter Content (LDMC) and
Specific Leaf Area (SLA)
of the beneficiary communities were found to respond to nurse patch and watering
treatments. We found that beneficiary communities located under nurses had a
higher SLA and lower LDMC than in open areas (Standardised coefficients: $\beta$
= `r l_m` and `r a_m` respectively, Fig. \@ref(fig:lt)). We further found strong
evidence for lower LDMC in watered treatment ($\beta$ = `r l_w`) but not SLA
($\beta$ = `r a_w`). We did not find evidence that community diversity affected
leaf traits (Fig. \@ref(fig:lt)).

We found that soil moisture was quite low, 7.25% on average in March and that
watering increased soil moisture by 4.24% 16 hours after watering (i.e. +58% in
March, Fig. S2, Table S1). However, nurse patches were not found to result in
higher soil moisture overall (4.0 95%CI:[3.1, 4.9] in nurse patch vs 4.0 [3.1,
4.9] in open non-watered microsites in June, Fig. S2). We found that nurse patches had a
temperature 3 celsius degrees lower than in the open at noon (32.3 [31.2, 33.5]
vs 28.9 [27.6, 30.1] in June, i.e. -11%, Fig. S2), and a Photosynthetic Active
Radiation 100 Quantum.$m^{-2}.s^{-1}$ lower than in the open (255 [229, 280] vs 358
[333, 383] in June, i.e. -29%, Fig. S2).


# Discussion {-}

One of the key questions about the role of facilitation in mitigating the
impacts of drought and climate change in dryland communities is how the species
diversity of beneficiary communities mediates facilitation and by which
mechanisms. We examined the roles of nurse plants and beneficiary communities'
species richness at two levels of drought stress with a manipulative field
experiment that allowed us to ask four questions: 1) How does species richness
of beneficiary communities affect nurse net effects on the survival and biomass
of those beneficiary communities? 2) How do nurse plants and water stress
interact in driving the response of the beneficiary communities? 3) How do nurse
plants affect complementarity and competitive hierarchy in beneficiary
communities? 4) How do nurse plants alter the functional traits of beneficiary
communities? Overall, we found that nurse facilitation only occurred in case of
species-diverse beneficiary communities and in the absence of watering. Nurse
and watering treatments had similar effects on complementarity (gain in biomass
in diverse beneficiary communities compared to monoculture) and on trait
plasticity. However, the nurse treatment differed from the watering one in its
effect on competitive hierarchy, as nurses facilitated more the most maladapted
species (i.e. slightly negative selection effects) regardless of the water
stress. In what follows, we discuss our results based on the wider context of
global change research in drylands, on previous work on facilitation, and on
ecological theory.

## Species richness and water stress determine nurse effects on survival and biomass of beneficiary communities

We found that nurses had weak and quasi-neutral net effects on the survival and
biomass of monospecific beneficiary communities, regardless of the level of
water stress. This result could be explained by a strong intraspecific
competition among the three beneficiary individuals in monoculture that swamps
the positive effects of the presence of the nurse. Those results are in line
with a recent meta-analysis, reporting that intraspecific competition is several
orders of magnitude higher than interspecific competition [@adler_competition_2018].
This is also in agreement with coexistence theory that predicts strong
competition among conspecific plants due to the absence of niche differences
[@chesson_general_2000; @kraft_plant_2015], and this effect appeared to
supersede the effect of nursing, regardless of the water treatment. Our results
suggest that accounting for competition among beneficiary species is an
important factor to understand the effects of nursing on beneficiary communities
[@schob_direct_2013; @michalet_disentangling_2015], and highlights the
importance of considering assemblages of multiple individuals when evaluating
and testing nurse effects.

In contrast to monospecific beneficiary communities, we found that nurses had
strong positive effects on plant survival and biomass in unwatered,
species-diverse beneficiary communities. This could be explained by the lower
competition experienced by the beneficiary species in species-diverse
communities, what makes the facilitation provided by the nurse exceed the
competition among beneficiary species. This is in line with  coexistence theory
which states that niche differentiation is key to achieve stable coexistence
[@chesson_general_2000]. However, we also found that the positive effect of the nurse in
mixture shifted to a negative effect in watered conditions, in accordance with
numerous studies showing that nurse-beneficiary net interactions shift from
positive in stressful environments to negative in more benign environments
[@bertness_positive_1994; @callaway_positive_2007;
@graff_species_2017]. This shift
toward a negative effect of the nurse could be due to two processes: watering
improved the performance of beneficiaries in open microsites, or nurses were
more efficient than beneficiary plants in consuming the added water in patch
microsites through a more developed root system [@aguiar_competition_1994;
@maestre_positive_2003]. Many dryland species respond quickly to water pulses,
yet the differences in size and associated capacity for water uptake
between an adult nurse plant and its neighbour saplings could explain that
watering primarily benefited the nurse plant [@morcillo_interacting_2022], thus
resulting, as in our study, in negative net effects between the nurse and
beneficiary communities.


## Nurse increases complementarity effects in beneficiary communities

We found consistent net positive effects of species richness on beneficiary
community biomass, driven solely by positive complementarity effects. We report
total net effects of biodiversity that are five times lower than previously
reported in species-rich, temperate grasslands [@loreau_partitioning_2001], and
we suggest that it could be due to three factors: (1) the combination of dryness
and drought conditions in the study, (2) the use of shrub species which have
slower growth than grass species, and (3) the small number of species in our
beneficiary communities. Overall, diversity net effects associated with
competitive hierarchy (measured by selection effects) were very low compared to
complementarity effects, a result that matches previous findings in grasslands
[@loreau_partitioning_2001; @fargione_selection_2007]. The dominance of
complementary effects rather than competitive hierarchy suggests that the
processes linked to niche differentiation and facilitation play a more important
role than the ones linked to competitive dominance. Watering increased
complementarity effects in open sites and nursing increased complementarity
effects in non-watered sites. This highlights, similar to functional traits, the
commonality in the effects of watering and nursing.


Although ten times lower than complementarity effects in magnitude, we found that the
effects of nurse plants on competitive hierarchy differed from the ones of watering,
such that watering enhanced competitive hierarchy in open sites (positive
selection effects) while nurse plants facilitated more the most
drought-sensitive species (negative selection effects) in water stress
conditions. The effect of watering on selection indicates that the direct
alleviation of water stress by watering results in the competitive dominance of
species that already perform best in monoculture while drier, more stressful
conditions suppress this competitive dominance. It agrees with previous findings
showing that even small changes in environmental conditions can result in a
shift in the competitive hierarchy among species [@morcillo_functional_2019;
@alexander_when_2016; @van_dyke_small_2022]. The small negative selection effects found in
nurse patches regardless of the water stress indicate that species that had the
lower biomass in monoculture had the higher increase in biomass in
species-diverse communities, suggesting that the more maladapted species
benefited the most from being in a nurse patch. This result lines up well with
earlier findings showing that nurse plants can change the competitive hierarchy
of beneficiary species [@schob_direct_2013; @michalet_disentangling_2015]
and that mal-adapted species tend to be the most facilitated species
[@liancourt_stress_2005; @graff_species_2017]. Hence, the use of nurse plants
may be key to maintain the positive effects of biodiversity on ecosystem
functioning, by buffering environmental stochasticity in ecosystems that are
expected to experience increasing extreme environmental variations
[@jiang_importance_2008; @wright_overlooked_2017].

## Effects of nurse on trait plasticity

We found that beneficiary communities followed less resource-conservative
strategies (or more resource-exploitative strategies) when watered or in a nurse
patch than when not watered or in open sites. Specifically, we found that the
LDMC of beneficiary communities decreased in watered microsites and in nurse
patch microsites. At biogeographic scales, LDMC has been found to decrease with
increasing annual rainfall [@borgy_plant_2017]. Our results suggest that we can
draw a parallel between the effects of being under a nurse and in sites with
increased water resources, which are both characterised by lower water deficit.
We further found an increase in the Specific Leaf Area (SLA) of beneficiary
communities in nurse patches, which might also indicate a less
resource-conservative strategy in nurse patches [@galmes_modulation_2005;
@zhang_mechanisms_2015]. Another possible explanation could be that the decrease
in LDMC and the increase in SLA in nurse patches might be due to the shading
effect of the nurse. Such shading can induce a compensation for the limited
amount of radiation received and is a common adaptation in understorey plants
[@pons_ecophysiological_1977; @ackerly_leaf_2002; @liu_does_2016;
@yang_effects_2019]. We, however, did not find that watering affected the SLA of
beneficiary communities in open sites, but did lead to lower LDMC. This result
suggests that the response of leaf traits to the decrease in water stress in
open sites did not imply changes in leaf area, possibly because of the higher
evapotranspiration in open sites, which might constrain leaf area to small sizes
despite lower water stress. Overall, our results are consistent with previous
results showing that a decrease in water stress results in plant plastic
responses toward higher SLA and lower LDMC [@galmes_modulation_2005;
@zhang_mechanisms_2015; @jung_intraspecific_2014, but see @majekova_weak_2021].
However, a direct measurement of plant physiological activity would be needed to
draw a stronger conclusion on the links among nurse presence, water stress, and
plant strategy. We did not find an effect of species richness of beneficiary
communities on average LDMC and SLA. This may be because functional traits are
expected to respond to variations in species richness in terms of trait variance
and overlap [@violle_return_2012; @danet_effects_2018] rather than in average
values, which are expected to respond to environmental changes as we found in
the present study [@enquist_scaling_2015; @danet_nurse_2017].

## Facilitation potential to mitigate climate change effects on biodiversity

Our results show that the facilitation provided by nurse plants can improve the
performance of species diverse beneficiary communities in water stress condition
by increasing biomass and survival, lead to trait plasticity
toward less water stress syndrome, increase the complementarity effects (i.e.
niche differentiation and facilitation) in beneficiary communities while
facilitating more the most maladapted species (i.e. negative selection effects)
of species regardless of the water stress. Furthermore, our results show that
the nurse effect is similar to the effect of adding water to open sites (on
functional traits and complementarity effects). Altogether, the results suggest
that facilitation by nurse shrubs can promote diversity of beneficiary
communities under high water deficit by increasing survival, which points to its
importance to maintaining biodiversity in a climate change context. Secondly,
our study also suggests that nurse shrubs can promote the species richness
effects on biomass production.

# Conclusion and perspectives

Our study reports a major role of the species richness of the beneficiary
communities in driving nurse net effects on survival and biomass, suggesting
that facilitation of beneficiary communities are more likely to happen to
species-diverse communities. Furthermore, we report that facilitation can
maintain high complementarity effects and alter competitive hierarchy among
beneficiary species despite water stress, indicating a key role of facilitation
in maintaining ecosystem functioning in stressful conditions. While our study
stresses that species-diverse beneficiary communities might benefit more from
facilitation provided by a nurse,  species-diverse beneficiary communities were
of three species, so that the generality of our result should be confirmed with
more species-diverse communities. Because most seedlings died after the first
summer, our study precludes strong inference over dryland dynamics timescale. It
is noteworthy, however, that the effects of species richness that we report
about complementarity and competitive hierarchy are consistent with the critical
findings in Biodiversity-Ecosystem Functioning [@loreau_partitioning_2001;
@fargione_selection_2007] and facilitation [@liancourt_stress_2005] research.
Our study opens up new perspectives on the mechanisms by which facilitation can
improve the functioning of water-limited ecosystems and contributes to integrate
facilitation more explicitly into biodiversity and ecosystem functioning
concepts.

Our study calls attention on the importance of facilitation in maintaining
biodiversity and biomass production in ecosystems that are expected to become
drier, as our results show that facilitation by nurse plants not only increase
the survival of plants in their species diverse understorey, but also amplify the beneficial
effects of species richness on biomass production. The potential of using
facilitation as a restoration tool in drylands largely depends on the nurse and
the beneficiary species [@fagundes_nurse-target_2022]. However, according to our
results, facilitation by nurse shrubs could help species-rich transplanted
communities to establish, by increasing the potential for niche differentiation
and facilitation among beneficiary species. The drawback of relying on such
keystone plants to maintain ecosystem functioning, is that if nurses come to be
impacted by climate change and/or targeted by land-use change, then we could
expect dramatic cascading effects in drylands communities
[@losapio_resistance_2017]. This is the well-known  ‘double-edge sword’ effect
of facilitation, where facilitation increases productivity and species richness
but also comes at the cost of increased fragility for the corresponding
ecological communities [@kefi_local_2007; @gross_positive_2008;
@kefi_evolution_2008; @kefi_how_2016; @danet_indirect_2020].
