# Abstract {-}

Climate change is expected to lead to more frequent and severe droughts,
constituting a growing threat to biodiversity, especially in drylands. Positive
plant-plant interactions, such as facilitation provided by nurse plants to
beneficiary communities, have the potential to mitigate those effects. This
requires taking into account the complexity of potentially species-rich
beneficiary communities, an aspect that has been overlooked so far. Here, we
investigated this effect in a Mediterranean semiarid abandoned cropland, where
we transplanted sapling beneficiary communities of either one or three species
either under a nurse or in open microsites and further crossed this design with
manipulation of soil moisture. Facilitation was only observed when beneficiary
communities were species diverse and without watering. When beneficiary
communities were either under a nurse or watered, the beneficiary community
biomass response was complementary: species showed a higher increase in biomass
than expected in monoculture. This response to alleviated stress was further
reflected in a shift in beneficiary species traits towards a low-stress profile.
Nurses also generated quasi-neutral selection effects, meaning that they
maintain competitive hierarchy among beneficiary species despite changes in
water stress level. Our results highlights the multiple pathways through which
nurse species can mitigate the loss of biodiversity due to climate change. On top of
maintaining species diversity by reducing environmental stress, we show that
nurse species have direct positive effects on the maintenance of richness in
beneficiary communities.

# Introduction {-}

Drylands, characterised by limited water availability for plants and animals,
are projected to face increasingly severe droughts due to climate change
[@pachauri_climate_2015]. Such prolonged dry periods can have detrimental
effects on plants, leading to reduced growth and increased mortality. Such
changes in  growth and mortality are likely to alter competitive hierarchies
among plants and thus their coexistence and the biodiversity of these habitats
[@hillerislambers_how_2013; @alexander_when_2016; @van_dyke_small_2022]. Improving
our understanding of how drought impacts growth, survival and competitive
interactions, and whether there are mechanisms that might buffer the direct
effects of climate change, are critical to predict the future of ecological
communities.

The potential for buffering these direct effects are particularly
relevant/crucial in drylands, where plants referred to as “benefactors” or
“nurses” facilitate other plants (“beneficiaries”) and are central/important
drivers of those communities’ structure and functioning
[@anthelme_positive_2007; @michalet_biotic_2006; @maestre_structure_2016]. Nurse
plants can improve environmental conditions beneath their canopy, e.g. by
decreasing the soil erosion, buffering the daily fluctuations in temperature,
and increasing water retention [@callaway_positive_2007]. Such facilitative
effects have been linked to increased species richness [@gross_positive_2008;
@cavieres_facilitative_2014], increased diversity in community composition
[@kikvidze_effects_2015], and play a tremendous role in large scale ecosystem
properties such as productivity [@cardinale_species_2002;
@wright_overlooked_2017], resilience [@kefi_local_2007; @kefi_spatial_2007] and
the spatial distribution of species in drylands. The improvement of
environmental conditions provided by nurse plants might therefore have the
potential to mitigate the effects of climate change on biodiversity.

However, the facilitative effects provided by nurse plants can be complex and
context dependent.  The net outcome of nurse-beneficiary interactions has been
shown to depend on the distance of the beneficiary to its physiological optimum,
in such a way that the most mal-adapted species are the most facilitated
[@liancourt_stress_2005; @graff_species_2017]. Also, the net effect of a nurse
on a beneficiary depends not only on the level, but also on the type of stress
[Stress-Gradient Hypothesis, @bertness_positive_1994; @maestre_refining_2009;
@graff_species_2017]. Furthermore, nurse plants can indirectly alter the
interactions among beneficiaries [@schob_direct_2013; @michalet_direct_2017].
This context dependency makes it hard to predict the effects of facilitation
expected in complex, species-rich, beneficiary communities.

Given that nurse plants can indirectly alter the interactions among
beneficiaries, it is thus likely that the impacts of facilitation on
communities facing stress is dependent on the diversity of the beneficiary
community. Community assembly theory provides key predictions about the outcome
of nurse-beneficiary interactions in species diverse communities. Facilitation
can be seen as an expansion of the niche of beneficiary species
[@bruno_inclusion_2003; @koffel_competition_2021], e.g. by making environmental conditions suitable for a
larger range of species, such as those that prefer higher moisture. This
expanded niche space is likely better exploited by species-rich beneficiary
communities that are able to use different aspects of this new resource space,
e.g. by having contrasted water use strategies, i.e. higher ‘niche
complementarity’ [@cardinale_species_2002; @loreau_partitioning_2001].
Furthermore, at the microsite scale, nurse plants increase habitat
heterogeneity, providing more available niche spaces for beneficiary plants
[@obrien_shift_2017]. Nurse species might also alter competitive dominance [i.e.
‘selection effects’, @loreau_partitioning_2001] in beneficiary communities such as
most mal-adapted species are disproportionately facilitated compared to well
adapted species. However, we know very little on how the facilitation provided
by the nurse affects beneficiary communities.

Here we report on an in situ experiment in a Mediterranean abandoned cropland
where we hypothesised that facilitation by nurse plants in drylands is stronger
for diverse than for monospecific beneficiary assemblages, and that this
facilitation effect is stronger under higher water stress. We addressed three
specific questions: 1) How does species richness affect nurse net effects on
survival and biomass? 2) How do nurse plants alter the water stress of
beneficiary communities? 3) How do nurse plants affect complementarity and
competitive hierarchy in beneficiary communities? To answer those questions, we
implemented a fully factorial design where we transplanted sapling communities
of three different beneficiary species either in monoculture or in mixture,
either in open or in a nurse-patch microsites. We further manipulated water
availability to alter the level of water stress experienced by the beneficiary
communities. To investigate the mechanisms behind nurse effects on beneficiary
communities, we further measured leaf functional traits related to resource
acquisition strategy and assessed how nurses affect beneficiary species
complementarity and competitive hierarchy.

## Study area {-}

The experiment was conducted in the Murcia region, Southeastern Spain
(37°57’33“N, 1°00’17”W – 172 m a.s.l.). Climate is semiarid Mediterranean with a
very high interannual variability. Annual rainfall follows a bimodal
distribution, with two rainy seasons (spring and autumn) and a very dry and warm
summer. Mean annual rainfall is 297 mm, and monthly average range from from 3 mm
in July to 36 mm in October. Mean annual temperature is 18.6 °C and range from
an average of  10.6 °C in January to 27.6 °C in August (Murcia Meteorological
Station, 38°00’7’‘N - 1°10’15’’W- 61 m a.s.l.; period: 1984-2010). Soils are
thin (20-50 cm), of silt-loam type (32% sand, 47% silt, 21% clay), and basic (pH
= 8.7). The area is a mosaic of moderately steep slopes covered by alpha-grass
(*Stipa tenacissima*) steppes and abandoned agricultural terraces built on the
streambeds. The agricultural terraces in the study site were abandoned in the 80s and 90s and
progressively colonised by forbs and shrubs (Fig. 1a). The extant perennial
vegetation is dominated by the shrub species *Artemisia herba-alba*, *Anthyllis
cytisoides* and *Pistacia lentiscus*.


## Experimental design {-}

To assess nursing effects on beneficiary communities, we set the beneficiary
communities either under the canopy of a nurse plant, *Artemisia herba-alba*, or
in open microsites. *Artemisia herba-alba* is a pioneer and common non-palatable
species in drylands [@alados_association_2006]. It was reported to be partially
phytotoxic, producing strong anti-germination compounds which however were not
reported to affect negatively sapling growth [@arroyo_phytotoxic_2018].

To assess how nurse effects varied with the species richness of the beneficiary
communities, we transplanted under the nurse either one beneficiary species
growing in monoculture, or a mix of three species (Fig. 1c). We selected three
different beneficiary species, so we had 4 different understorey community types
in total (3 monocultures and 1 mixture). We selected three common shrub species
of the Mediterranean steppes as beneficiary species, namely *Anthyllis
citisoides*, *Dorycnium pentaphyllum* and *Pistacia lentiscus*, which are
commonly found to co-occur in the same landscape [@amat_community_2015]. All
those species have characteristics which are considered to be adaptations to the
semi-arid climates. *Anthyllis citisoides* is a drought-avoider and sheds its
leaves during summer, thereby decreasing the transpiring area
[@haase_photosynthetic_2000]. *Pistacia lentiscus* is a late successional
evergreen shrub which can develop a dense root system at the sapling stage
within one year after transplantation [@maestre_positive_2003]. It can also
increase the water storage in its leaves during the hot and dry season
[@maestre_mechanisms_2004], and the thick cuticle of its leaves
[@coste_flore_1937] limits the loss of water by evapotranspiration. *Dorycnium
pentaphyllum* is a low-growing species known for its resistance to water stress
[@caravaca_use_2003]. Its leaves are composed of segments which decrease the
transpiring surface.

We assessed how the level of water stress modulated the nurse effects on
beneficiary communities by supplementing beneficiary communities with 1.5L of
water by microsite 8 times during 2016 (January, March, April, May, June, July,
August and October). We did so by emptying one water bottle by microsite.

We used a fully factorial design that included 3 treatments with two levels
each: microsite (nurse patch/ open),  assemblage diversity (monospecific /
diverse), and watering (yes / no), with three types of monospecific assemblages,
one per each target beneficiary species, resulting in 16 combinations of
treatments and assemblages, each of them replicated 20 times. The treatment
combinations were distributed among 3 terraces (Fig. 1b) so that treatments were
replicated 6 to 7 times per terrace. Because of the abundance of grazers in the
area (mainly rabbits), every terrace was fenced with 1.80 metres height wire
fences and reinforced by chicken wire extending from about 60 cm above ground to
20 cm below ground.

The transplantation of beneficiary communities was done between October 23 and
November 4, 2015, into planting holes of approximately 25×25×25 cm dug manually.
The holes benefiting from the nurse plant effect (hereafter named “nurse patch”)
were located below the canopy of the benefactor, about 20 cm apart from the main
stem of the plant, and oriented northward to maximise the shading effect. One
week before planting saplings, the area received about 40 mm of natural rainfall
(affecting all terraces equally), which provided excellent initial moisture
conditions for the planted saplings. The holes were randomly attributed to the
different treatments. We planted three saplings per hole, following a triangular
arrangement in which the plant stems were equally distant from each other
(approximately 10 cm). Plants were bought in small pots containing several
individuals, leading to some microsites having several live individuals and
others had 100% mortality due to transplantation shock. To exclude this initial
variation in the number of individuals per microsite, we only considered holes
in which at least one individual from the original container survived in
January, and removed supernumerary individuals by cutting their stems at their
basis. In order to estimate the total biomass of the beneficiary plants during
the course of the experiment, we collected twelve individuals of each species
during the plantation. We then separated the stem, the leaves and the roots and
dried them at 65°C for 3 days to obtain the total biomass. We then calibrated an
allometric relationship of total biomass according to basal diameter and maximal
height with a species effect following previous studies
[@catchpole_estimating_1992; @nafus_multispecies_2009]. We log-transformed total
biomass, basal diameter and vegetative height prior to modelling. The R² of the
model was quite high ($R^2$ = `r r2bm["R2"]`, adjusted $R^2$ = `r r2bm["adj"]`),
and we found a good  agreement between predicted and observed values (Fig. S1,
see estimated coefficients in Table S1). This allometric relationship provided
an estimated plant biomass based on the non-lethal measurement of plant height
and stem diameter in the field (considering either only basal diameter or total
biomass did not alter our conclusions, see Fig. S2). During the experiment, we
measured the performance of individual beneficiary plants by recording (1) their
survival and (2) their total biomass (using the above allometric relationship)
from January to October 2016 (10 months).

We assessed changes in the functional traits of beneficiaries to investigate
their mechanistic response to the presence of a nurse and the addition of water.
We focused on two leaf traits known to reflect different resource acquisition
strategies, Leaf Dry Matter Content (LDMC) and Specific Leaf Area [SLA, @perez-harguindeguy_new_2013]. The leaves of beneficiary plants were collected
and processed in March 2016 (4 months after the plantation) following guidelines
from @perez-harguindeguy_new_2013. We collected only leaves without traces
of disease, grazing or senescence, that were mature and most exposed to sunlight
(i.e. close to the top of the main stem). We collected a small number of leaves,
and only from the most healthy individuals, as to assume that their response to
experimental conditions would  not be affected by the leaf sampling. We
collected 3 leaves per plant for *P. lentiscus*, 5 leaves for *A. citisoides* and 10 leaves for
*D. pentaphyllum*, so that the overall dry leaf biomass of each sample was high
enough to accurately weight them. Leaves from each individual were stored in a
plastic tube with a humid tissue to limit desiccation and stored in
thermally-isolated cooler for transportation. Leaves were then  first rehydrated
with deionised water for several minutes, weighted, scanned, and then dried at
least 48h at 72°C. Once dry, we weighted individual leaves to compute LDMC and
SLA. We a priori selected a random subset of microsites to be sampled and then we
effectively sampled only the subset that met the above conditions, to reach
a minimal sampling size per treatment combination of 7 samples for SLA
(max 36), 13 samples for LDMC (max 75, Table S2).


## Data analysis {-}

The analysis of the data consisted in two steps. We modelled the survival, the
biomass, and the leaf functional traits of the beneficiary communities to assess
the effects of experimental treatments. We then used the predicted values of survival
and biomass to compute the net effects of the nurse on beneficiary communities,
and the predicted values of biomass to compute complementarity and selection
effects.

### Modelling survival and biomass of beneficiary communities {-}

We used mixed-effect generalised linear models to test whether the presence of
the nurse affected the performance of beneficiary communities, i.e. their total
biomass and their survival, for different species richness (monoculture or mix
of three species) and levels of water stress.  The presence of the nurse, the
species richness of the beneficiary communities and the watering treatment were
set as fixed effects. Because we hypothesised that the nurse effect on
beneficiary communities was modulated by water stress level and the richness of
the beneficiary communities, we included the two-way and three-way interactions.

We further accounted for the following sources of variation via additional fixed
effects: species identity of the beneficiary communities, time in months since
the start of the experiment, and terrace identity. We added an extra quadratic
effect of time as a fixed effect in the biomass model as it was found to
decrease after summer. We further accounted for microsite level variation (i.e.
hole containing the beneficiary communities nested within the terrace level) by
specifying a random effect with these terms (Table S3).

---
#In addition to the analysis of the experiment, we also fit a model to
#investigate species specific responses. To do this, we modified the above model
#by specifying an interaction between each fixed effect and the species identity.
#This allowed us to further explore how each species responded to the treatments,
#but is complex because it includes four-way interactions.
---

All models were fit using a Bayesian framework. We fit the biomass response
variable with a gaussian error structure and the survival response variable with
a binomial one with a logit link function. We used the Integrated Nested
Laplacian Approximation (INLA)  to fit models [@rue_approximate_2009;
@rue_bayesian_2017] based on the INLA R package [@rue_approximate_2009], with
default uninformative priors. The prior distribution of fixed coefficients
followed a flat, zero centred, normal distribution ($\mathcal{N}(\mu,\,
\sigma^2) = \mathcal{N}(0,\, 1000)$). The prior distribution of the random
effects and the gaussian error followed a log gamma distribution with shape and
inverse scale parameters ($\mathcal{G}(s, \, \tau) = \mathcal{G}(1, \,
5.10^-5)$). We then back-transformed the estimated coefficients to to the
standard deviations attributed to the random effects and the gaussian error
($\sigma = 1 / \sqrt{\tau}$). We computed the credible intervals for each model
parameters at 80%, 90% and 95% using the Highest Posterior Density method
[@hyndman_computing_1996], which can respectively be interpreted as weak,
moderate and strong evidence of an effect when the interval does not include 0
[@mastrandrea_guidance_2010; @van_klink_meta-analysis_2020].

We checked the overall quality of the model fit to the data visually by plotting
the fitted versus the observed values (Fig. S3, Table S4). We visually inspected the PIT
and CPO (respectively Posterior Integral Transform and Conditional Predictive
Ordinate) distribution to assess both the quality of data representation, and
the frequency of outliers.


### Estimate nurse net effects on survival and biomass of beneficiary communities {-}

We used the statistical models above to obtain a prediction of plant biomass and
survival probability through time for all treatments, that we used to compute
summary indices of interactions. The net effect of the nurse-beneficiary
interactions was estimated with the Neighbor-effect Intensity index [NInt,
@diaz-sierra_new_2016]. Positive values indicate positive net effects of the
nurse on beneficiary communities (i.e. facilitation) while negative values
indicate net negative effects of the nurse (i.e. competition). We used this
index instead of the more-commonly used RII as the NInt is symmetric around
zero, i.e. positive and negative effects of the same magnitude are captured by
opposite values (e.g. +10/-10). The NInt is computed as follows:

\begin{equation}
    NInt_A = 2 \frac{ \Delta P }{P_{-N} + |\Delta P|}
    (\#eq:int)
\end{equation}

with ($P_{-N}$) the performance of the beneficiary species in open microsites and ($\Delta P$) the
difference between the performance of beneficiary species in nurse patches and
in open microsites (i.e. $P_{+N} - P_{-N}$). We used the sampled distribution of predicted
values of survival and biomass (N = 1000 sampling) to compute the mean and the
credible intervals at 80% of the Nint index.

### Nurse effects on the water stress of beneficiary species

To better understand the underlying mechanism through which nurse plants affect
the beneficiary communities, we analysed how experimental treatments affected
leaf functional traits in beneficiary communities (LDMC and SLA). We used the
same statistical models as above (i.e. fixed effect of water treatment,
presence/absence of nurse and species richness of beneficiary communities, along
with their interactions ). These models did not include time as a fixed effect
as functional traits were measured only once.

### Nurse effects on complementarity and competitive hierarchy in beneficiary communities

We further used the predictions of survival and biomass of the above statistical
models to estimate how nurse affects complementarity and competitive hierarchy
(i.e. selection effects) in beneficiary communities [@loreau_partitioning_2001].  The
complementarity effect measures if species in diverse communities have higher or
lower biomass than expected from monoculture. A negative complementarity effect reflects a
prevalence of competitive interference in beneficiary communities, while
positive values indicate the prevalence of resource use partitioning or
facilitation among beneficiary species. Selection effects assess changes in
species dominance in the beneficiary communities. Negative selection effects
indicate that species that have the lowest performance (here, measured as
biomass) in monoculture are the ones that have the highest relative gain in
biomass in mixture and reversely. Positive selection effects indicate that
species that have the highest biomass in monoculture have also the highest biomass
gain in diverse communities. We partitioned the net effect of increasing species
richness of beneficiary communities in complementarity and selection effects using
the partition of @loreau_partitioning_2001. The net effect of species richness is
computed as the difference between the sum of species biomass in mixture to the
average biomass in monoculture [@fargione_selection_2007]. Selection effects were
computed as the species richness (i.e. 3) times the covariance between the
species relative biomass change from monoculture to mixture and the species
biomass in monoculture. Complementarity effects are computed as the species
richness times the average species relative biomass change from monoculture to
mixture times the average species biomass in monoculture. As for Nint
computation, we used biomass prediction from the statistical model to compute
the diversity net effects and their 80% credible intervals.

## Net effects of the nurse on survival and biomass of beneficiary communities


We found no effect of the presence of the nurse alone on the survival and
biomass of monospecific beneficiary communities (survival odd-ratio = `r s_m`,
Fig. \@ref(fig:sbm)a; biomass: $\beta$ = `r b_m`, Fig. \@ref(fig:sbm)b),
resulting in an overall slight negative net effect of the nurse (Fig. 2c, d, red
and blue points).

We further found that, in open microsites, the diverse beneficiary communities had
the same survival (OR = `r s_c`, Fig. \@ref(fig:sbm)a) but lower biomass
($\beta$ = `r b_c`, Fig. \@ref(fig:sbm)b) than monospecific communities.
Watering increased the survival and biomass of beneficiary communities in open
microsites (survival: OR = `r s_w`, biomass: $\beta$ = `r b_w`), and this effect
was hastened in diverse beneficiary communities (survival: OR = `r s_wc`,
biomass: $\beta$ = `r b_wc`). The positive watering effect on survival and
biomass in monospecific beneficiary communities was similar regardless of the
presence of absence of the nurse (survival: OR = `r s_wm`, biomass: $\beta$ =
`r b_wm`), resulting in near-neutral net effects of the nurse on monospecific
beneficiary communities in watered and non-watered treatments (Fig. \@ref(fig:sbm)c & d, red and
blue points).

Diverse beneficiary communities under nurses had higher survival and biomass
than monospecific beneficiary communities in the same conditions (strong support
for survival, OR = `r s_cm`, Fig. \@ref(fig:sbm)a, and weak support for biomass
$\beta$ = `r b_cm`, Fig. \@ref(fig:sbm)b), resulting in a strong positive net effect
of the nurse in diverse and non watered assemblages (Fig. 2 c & d, red

## Effect of the nurse on the traits of the beneficiaries

We found a similar response of the functional traits of the beneficiary
communities to the nurses and watering treatments (nurse and water alone in Fig.
3a). The Leaf Dry Matter Content (LDMC) and Specific Leaf Area (SLA) of the
beneficiary communities were found to respond to nurse patch and watering
treatments. We found that beneficiary communities located under nurses had a
higher SLA and lower LDMC than in open areas (Standardised coefficients:
$\beta$ = `r l_m` and `r a_m` respectively, Fig. \@ref(fig:lt)a). We further
found strong evidence for lower LDMC in watered treatment ($\beta$ = `r l_w`)
but not SLA ($\beta$ = `r a_w`). We did not find evidence that community
diversity affected leaf traits (Fig. \@ref(fig:lt)a).

## Effects of the nurse on complementarity and competitive hierarchy

Partitioning the effects of species richness on the biomass of beneficiary
communities, we found that the presence of the nurse interacted with water
stress level to determine complementarity and selection effects (Fig. 3b). We
always found positive net effects of species diversity on beneficiary biomass,
driven by positive complementarity effects. Without watering, complementarity
increased under nurses compared to open microsites (Fig. 3b, red lines),
indicating that the nurse promotes the positive effects of species richness.
Conversely, with watering, increase in complementarity was higher in open
microsites than under nurse patches. In open microsites, the increase in
complementarity effects was much larger for watered beneficiary communities than
for non-watered ones (Fig. 3b, rounded points), while watering hardly increased
complementarity in nurse patches (Fig. 3b, triangular points). We further found
that watering decreased selection effects from positive to quasi neutral in open
microsites (Fig. 3b, rounded points), while watering had no effect on selection
in nurse patches (triangle points). In nurse patches, selection effects were
quasi-neutral regardless of the water stress conditions.



# Discussion {-}

One of the key questions about the role of facilitation buffering the impacts of
drought and climate change in dryland communities is how the species diversity
of beneficiary communities mediates facilitation and its effects.  We examined
the role of beneficiary species diversity with a manipulative field experiment
that allowed us to ask three key questions: 1) How does species richness affect
nurse net effects on survival and biomass? 2) How do nurse plants alter the
water stress of beneficiary communities?, and 3) How do nurse plants affect
complementarity and competitive hierarchy in beneficiary communities? Overall, we
found that nurse facilitation only occurred in case of species diverse
beneficiary communities and in the absence of watering. Nurse and watering
treatments had similar effects on complementarity (gain in biomass in
diverse beneficiary communities compared to monoculture) and on the traits of
beneficiaries. However, the nurse treatment differed from watering in its effect
on competitive hierarchy, as nurse maintained quasi-neutral selection effects. Here
we review our results in the wider context of global change research in drylands
and previous work on facilitation and ecological theory.


## Species richness and water stress determine nurse effects on survival and biomass of beneficiary communities

We found that nurses had weak and quasi-neutral net effects on the survival and
biomass of monospecific beneficiary communities, regardless of the level of
water stress. This result could be explained by a
strong intraspecific competition among the 3 beneficiary individuals in
monoculture that swamps the positive effects of the presence of the nurse. Those results are in line
with the meta-analysis reporting that intraspecific competition is several orders
of magnitude higher than interspecific competition [@adler_competition_2018].
This is also aligned with coexistence theory that predicts strong competition
among conspecific plants due to the absence of niche differences
[@chesson_general_2000; @kraft_plant_2015], and this effect appeared to
supersede the effect of nursing, regardless of the water treatment. Our results
suggest that taking in account the strength of competition among beneficiaries
might be key to predict the effects of nursing.

In contrast with monospecific beneficiary communities, we found that the nurse
had strong positive effects on plant survival and biomass in diverse beneficiary
communities, but only when not watered. These results are in line with the numerous
studies showing that nurse-beneficiary net interactions shift from positive in
stressful environments to negative in more benign environments
[@bertness_positive_1994; @callaway_positive_2007; @graff_species_2017]. This
shift could be held by two processes: watering improved the performance of
beneficiaries in open microsites, but nurses were more efficient than
beneficiary plants in consuming the added water in patch microsites. Many
dryland species quickly respond to water pulses, yet the differences in size and
associated capacity for water uptake between an adult nurse plant and its
neighbour saplings could explain that watering primarily benefited the nurse
plant [@morcillo_interacting_2022], even resulting, as in our study, in negative
net effects between the nurse and beneficiary communities.


## Effects of nurse on functional traits

We found that beneficiary communities followed less resource-conservative
strategy (or a more resource-exploitative strategy) when being watered or in a
nurse patch than when being not watered or in open sites. More specifically, we
found that the LDMC of beneficiary communities decreased in watered microsites
and in nurse patch microsites. At a broader scale, LDMC has been found to
decrease  with increasing annual rainfall [@borgy_plant_2017]. Our results suggest that we can draw a
parallel between the effects of being under a nurse and the increase in water
resources, could be both related to lower water deficit. We further found an increase in the
Specific Leaf Area of beneficiary communities in nurse patch sites, indicating
as well the development of a less resource conservative strategy in nurse
patches. However, we did not find that watering affects the SLA of beneficiary
communities. Previous studies showed that light reduction results in higher
SLA, which is a compensation for the limited amount of radiation received and a
common adaptation for understory plants [@liu_does_2016]. Another hypothesis is
that the decrease in SLA is not happening in open sites despite watering because
of the higher evapotranspiration in open sites, which might in turn promote the
maintenance of the same leaf area despite less water stress. Overall our results
suggest that the effects of both the nurse and water addition lead to partly
similar leaf physiological responses but the effects of shading in nurse patches
might make LMDC a more suitable functional trait than SLA to assess the response
of beneficiary communities to nursing. We did not find an effect of
the species richness of beneficiary communities on average LDMC and SLA. This
might be explained by the prediction that average functional traits should be
driven more by environmental filtering [@enquist_scaling_2015; @danet_nurse_2017]
while response of functional traits related to species diversity might be more
prevalent on trait overlap among beneficiary species [@violle_return_2012; @danet_effects_2018].

## Nurse increases complementarity effects in beneficiary communities

Our results also provide insights on how species richness effects were
partitioned in complementarity and selection effects. We found consistent net
positive effects of species richness on beneficiary community biomass, driven by
positive complementarity effects. These findings are in agreement  with previous
results from Biodiversity-Ecosystem Functioning experiments
[@loreau_partitioning_2001; @fargione_selection_2007]. We further found that
watering increased complementarity effects in open sites and that nurse
increased complementarity effects in no watered sites, indicating again that there
is a parallel between the effect in resource increase and nursing effects. We
further found that in watered sites, the nurse did not increase complementarity
effects in beneficiary communities compared to open sites, which can be related
with the negative net effects of nurse on biomass found in watered diverse
beneficiary communities. Interestingly, we found that higher water stress led to
positive selection effects in open sites (compared to quasi neutral at low water
stress level), i.e. that species that had higher biomass in monoculture had the
higher biomass in diverse beneficiary communities. It resonates with previous
results showing that even small changes in environmental conditions can shift
competitive hierarchy among species [@hillerislambers_how_2013;
@alexander_when_2016; @van_dyke_small_2022].  In contrast, we found quasi
neutral selective effects in nurse patches regardless of the water stress level,
indicating that nurses maintain dominance among beneficiary species despite
changes in water stress level. This result is in line with previous studies
showing that nurse plants can change the competitive hierarchy of beneficiary
species [@schob_direct_2013; @michalet_disentangling_2015]. The maintenance of
low selection effects in nurse patches regardless of the water stress might also
be the signal that nurse plants might prevent strong competitive hierarchy to
arise despite harsh environmental conditions [@danet_effects_2018], which might
be key to maintain the positive effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning
[@jiang_importance_2008].

## Facilitation potential to mitigate climate change effects on biodiversity

Our results show that the facilitation provided by nurse plants can improve the
performance of species diverse beneficiary communities in high water stress
level, lead to change in leaf functional traits toward less water stress syndrome, increase the complementarity effects (i.e. niche
differentiation and facilitation) in beneficiary communities while maintaining
dominance of species regardless of the water stress. Furthermore, our results
show that the nurse effect is similar to the effect of adding water to open
sites (on functional traits and complementarity effects). Altogether, the
results  suggest that facilitation by nurse shrubs promotes diversity of
beneficiary communities under high water deficit, which points to its importance
to maintaining biodiversity in a climate change context. The potential of using
facilitation as a potential restoration tool in drylands largely depends on the
nurse and the beneficiary target species [@fagundes_nurse-target_2022]. However,
according to our results, facilitation by nurse shrubs could help to establish
species-rich transplanted communities by increasing the potential for niche
differentiation and facilitation among beneficiary species. However, if nurses
come to be impacted by climate change and/or targeted by land-use change, then
we could expect dramatic cascading effects in drylands communities.


# Conclusion and perspectives

Our study suffers from some limits that might impede its generalisability. Here,
diverse beneficiary communities were only composed of three species, which is a
relatively low number of species compared to natural dryland communities, and we
used a nurse plant, *Artemisia herba-alba*, which is known to produce phytotoxic
compounds [@arroyo_phytotoxic_2018]; different results might be expected with a less
inhibitory nurse plants. Another limit of our experiment is that it only lasts
for one year because most saplings have died after the first summer. Therefore,
predictions of nursing effects over a longer time are difficult to estimate,
such as longer time scales might change effects of the nurse on complementarity
and selection effects in beneficiary communities [@fargione_selection_2007]. However,
our study reports a major role of the species richness of the  beneficiary
communities in driving nurse net effects on survival and biomass. It indicates
that facilitation of beneficiary communities are more likely to happen to
species diverse communities. Furthermore, our study shows that facilitation can
maintain high complementarity effects and low selection effects despite water
stress. Then, our study opens new perspectives on how facilitation acts on
species diverse communities and contributes to integrate facilitation more
explicitly into biodiversity and ecosystem functioning concepts.
