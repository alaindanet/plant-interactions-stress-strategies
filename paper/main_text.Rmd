# Abstract {-}

Climate change is expected to lead to a drier world, with more frequent and
severe droughts, constituting a growing threat to biodiversity, especially in
drylands. Positive plant-plant interactions, such as nurse plants facilitating
beneficiary communities in their understory, could mitigate such climate-induced
stress. However, testing the real-world relevance of nurse facilitation under
drought requires accounting for interactions within the diverse beneficiary
communities, which may reduce, or amplify the buffering effect of a nurse. Here,
we investigated the when and how the interactions among nurse plants and
beneficiary community members buffered drought effects in a Mediterranean
semiarid abandoned cropland. We transplanted sapling beneficiary communities of
either one or three species either under a nurse or in open microsites for
different soil moisture levels through watering. Net facilitative effects on
survival and biomass were only observed when beneficiary communities were
species-diverse and under drought (without watering). Under these conditions,
facilitation provided by the nurse had larger positive effects than the negative
effects stemming from competition with the nurse and among beneficiary species.
Nurses appear to be generating these increases in survival and biomass via two
mechanisms commonly associated with watering: they generate complementarity
among the beneficiaries and shift traits to low stress profiles. Contrasting
with watering, nurses appear to alter species dominance, favouring the worst off
species. Our results highlight three mechanisms by which nurse species could
mitigate the loss of biodiversity and biomass production due to drought arising
under climate change.  Maintaining and supporting nurse species is thus a
potentially pivotal approach in the face of projected increases in severity and
frequency of droughts across the world.

# Introduction {-}

Climate change has already led to a rise in the frequency of extreme heat and
drought events, a trend observed globally over recent decades and projected to
persist [@lee_ipcc_2023]. Such conditions have direct detrimental effects
on plants, especially those not adapted to prolonged and frequent periods of
water stress, and will likely alter ecosystem structure and functioning in the
long term [@muller_drought_2022]. The changes to ecosystem structure and
functioning will certainly arise in part to do changes in plant-plant
interactions and plant coexistence [@alexander_when_2016; @graff_species_2017].
However, plant-plant interactions may also modulate the level of water stress
experienced by plants [@maestre_positive_2003], potentially buffering the
impacts of increasingly drier conditions [@morcillo_functional_2019]. A key
example of such buffering arises from the hypothesised positive impacts of nurse
plants [@callaway_positive_2007]. Improving our understanding of how species
interactions both respond to and shape responses to drought  is critical to
predict the future of plant communities in a drier world.


The potential for alleviating the detrimental effects of water stress can be
estimated in  drylands, which already exhibit limited water availability for
plants and animals. In drylands, plants referred to as “benefactors” or “nurses”
that facilitate other plants (“beneficiaries”) are key drivers of community
structure and functioning [@anthelme_positive_2007; @michalet_biotic_2006;
@maestre_structure_2016]. Nurse plants can improve environmental conditions
beneath their canopy, e.g. by reducing soil erosion, buffering the daily
fluctuations in temperature, and increasing water retention
[@callaway_positive_2007].
Such facilitative effects correlate with increased species richness
[@gross_positive_2008; @cavieres_facilitative_2014], increased diversity in
community composition [@kikvidze_effects_2015], and underpin large scale ecosystem
properties such as productivity [@cardinale_species_2002;
@wright_overlooked_2017], resilience and the spatial distribution of species in
drylands [@kefi_local_2007; @kefi_spatial_2007]. Nurse plants, by improving
local environmental conditions, could thus mitigate the effects of increasing
severity and frequency of drought events on biodiversity and ecosystem
functioning.

However, in order to accurately assess the potential of facilitative effects for
mitigating climate change, one must evaluate nurse effects in biodiverse
communities and disentangle the multiple mechanisms by which they operate and
contexts in which they arise. We propose three key mechanisms to monitor that
are stemming from trait-based ecology and ecosystem functioning research:
selection effects (i.e. competitive hierarchy), complementarity effects (i.e.
niche differentiation and facilitation) and trait profile changes (plasticity).
There are pieces of evidence for all three of these, which we review below
before introducing our experiment and data that address all three
simultaneously.


Community assembly theory provides key predictions about the outcome of
nurse-beneficiary interactions in species-diverse communities. Facilitation can
be seen as an expansion of the niche of beneficiary species
[@bruno_inclusion_2003; @koffel_competition_2021], e.g. by making environmental
conditions suitable for a larger range of species, such as those
that prefer higher moisture. Furthermore, at the microsite scale, nurse plants
increase habitat heterogeneity, further extending the niche space available to
beneficiary plants for beneficiary plants [@obrien_shift_2017]. This expanded
niche space is likely better exploited by species-rich beneficiary communities
that are able to use different aspects of this new resource space, e.g. by
having contrasted water use strategies, i.e. higher ‘niche complementarity’
[@cardinale_species_2002; @loreau_partitioning_2001], or in cases where
beneficiaries directly facilitate each other. Previous research identified that
facilitation from nurse plants beneficiate the more to species the least drought
resistant [@liancourt_stress_2005; @graff_species_2017], and
that nurses can alter competitive hierarchy among beneficiary species
[@schob_direct_2013;@michalet_direct_2017], which are coined as “selection
effects” [@loreau_partitioning_2001]. Previous studies reported that
species richness increases complementarity but have contrasting effects on
selection [@loreau_partitioning_2001;@fargione_selection_2007], such as
complementarity effects are responsible for the positive effects of species
richness on grassland productivity. Investigating how nurse-provided
facilitation affects complementarity (i.e. niche differentiation and
facilitation) and selection (i.e. competitive hierarchy) in beneficiary
communities can thus bridge the gap between facilitation and ecosystem
functioning research [@wright_overlooked_2017].

By modifying local environmental conditions, nurse plants are also expected to
alter the physiology and resource exploitation strategies of the beneficiary
plants, which can be assessed using leaf functional traits. In harsh
environments, previous research identified that beneficiary species located
beneath and within a nurse display higher variability in leaf trait composition,
but also less-stressed leaf trait syndromes than beneficiary species located in
open sites [@schob_foundation_2012; @schob_direct_2013; @schob_trait-based_2017;
@danet_nurse_2017; @danet_effects_2018]. Accounting for how the
presence of the nurse and water stress modulate functional traits is therefore a
valuable way to further understand the mechanisms by which facilitation operates
on beneficiary plants.

Here we report on an in situ experiment designed to provide evidence that
facilitative effects provided by nurse species in drylands is stronger for
diverse than for monospecific beneficiary communities, and that those
facilitative effects are lower under lower water stress. To gather this evidence
we performed a fully factorial experiment crossing beneficiary species diversity
(three species in monoculture and three species communities), presence and
absence of nurse species (nurse patch vs. open) and presence and absence of
watering (reduced drought vs drought). This experiment allows us to gather data
about the relative importance of complementarity, selection effects and trait
profiles in shaping patterns of facilitation. Specifically, with this design, we
ask the following 4 questions. 1) How does species richness of beneficiary
communities affect nurse net effects on the survival and biomass of those
beneficiary communities? 2) How do nurse plants alter the functional traits of
beneficiary communities? 3) How do nurse plants affect complementarity and
competitive hierarchy in beneficiary communities? 4) How do nurse plants and
water stress interact in driving the response of the beneficiary communities?

## Study area {-}


The experiment was conducted in 2016 in the Murcia region, Southeastern Spain
(37°57’33“N, 1°00’17”W – 172 m a.s.l.). The region’s climate is semiarid
Mediterranean with a very high year to year variability. Annual rainfall follows
a bimodal distribution, with two rainy seasons (spring and autumn) and a very
dry and warm summer. Mean annual rainfall is 297 mm, and monthly average ranges
from 3 mm in July to 36 mm in October. Mean annual temperature is 18.6 °C and
range from an average of 10.6 °C in January to 27.6 °C in August (Murcia
Meteorological Station, 38°00’7’’N - 1°10’15”W- 61 m a.s.l.; period: 1984-2010).
The year of 2016 was part of a series of nine consecutive drier than average
years from 2011 to 2020 in the region (Standardised Precipitation
Evapotranspiration Index over one year, https://spei.csic.es/index.html). Soils
are thin (20-50 cm), of silt-loam type (32% sand, 47% silt, 21% clay), and basic
(pH = 8.7). The area is a mosaic of moderately steep slopes covered by
alpha-grass (Stipa tenacissima) steppes and abandoned agricultural terraces
built on the streambeds. The agricultural terraces in the study site were
abandoned in the 80s and 90s and progressively colonised by forbs and shrubs
(Fig. \@ref(fig:exp)a). The extant perennial vegetation is dominated by the
shrubs *Artemisia herba-alba*, *Anthyllis cytisoides* and *Pistacia lentiscus*.

## Experimental design {-}

To assess the nursing effects on beneficiary communities, we set the beneficiary
communities either under the canopy of a nurse plant, *Artemisia herba-alba*, or
in open microsites. *A. herba-alba* is a pioneer and common non-palatable species
in drylands, known for extending its grazing protection toward palatable plants
[@alados_association_2006; @verwijmeren_drought_2014], and a closely related species
Artemisia tridendata was previously shown to positively alter microclimate
[@callaway__1996]. It was reported to be partially phytotoxic, producing
strong anti-germination compounds, which however were not reported to affect
negatively sapling growth [@arroyo_phytotoxic_2018].

To assess how nurse effects varied with the species richness of the beneficiary
communities, we transplanted under the nurse and in open microsites either one
beneficiary species growing in monoculture, or a mix of three species (Fig.
\@ref(fig:exp)c). We selected three different beneficiary species, so we had 4
different understorey community types in total (3 monocultures and 1 mixture).
We selected three common shrub species of the Mediterranean steppes as
beneficiary species, namely *Anthyllis citisoides*, *Dorycnium pentaphyllum* and
*Pistacia lentiscus*, which are commonly found to co-occur in the same
communities [@amat_community_2015]. All those species have characteristics that
are considered to be adaptations to the semi-arid climates. *Anthyllis
citisoides* is a drought-avoider and sheds its leaves during summer, thereby
decreasing the transpiring area [@haase_photosynthetic_2000]. *Pistacia
lentiscus* is a late successional evergreen shrub which can develop a dense root
system at the sapling stage within one year after transplantation
[@maestre_positive_2003]. It can also increase the water storage in its leaves
during the hot and dry season [@maestre_mechanisms_2004], and the thick cuticle
of its leaves [@coste_flore_1937] limits the loss of water by
evapotranspiration. *Dorycnium pentaphyllum* is a low-growing species known for
its resistance to water stress [@caravaca_use_2003]. Its leaves are composed of
segments which decrease the transpiring surface.

To assess how the level of water stress interacted with the nurse effects on
beneficiary communities, we manipulated soil moisture by supplementing
beneficiary communities with 1.5L of water per planting microsite and compared
with control (not watered) beneficiary communities. We watered the planting
microsites 8 times during 2016 around 6pm to avoid the strongest
evapotranspiration, once a month in spring and summer (i.e. March, April, May,
June, July, and August) and every two months otherwise (i.e. January and
October). We did so by emptying one water bottle per microsite. We measured soil
moisture 16 hours after watering in January, March, and June using a hand-held
TDR sensor (Fig. S1).

We used a fully factorial design that included 3 treatments with two levels
each: microsite (nurse patch/ open), assemblage diversity (monospecific /
diverse), and watering (yes / no), with three types of monospecific assemblages,
one per each target beneficiary species, resulting in 16 combinations of
treatments and assemblages, each of them replicated 20 times. The treatment
combinations were distributed among 3 terraces (Fig. 1b) so that treatments were
replicated 6 to 7 times per terrace. Because of the abundance of grazers in the
area (mainly rabbits), every terrace was fenced with 1.80 metres height wire
fences and reinforced by chicken wire extending from about 60 cm above ground to
20 cm below ground.


## Experimental setting and measurements

```

The transplantation of beneficiary communities was done between October 23 and
November 4, 2015, into planting holes (beforehand and hereafter named
“microsite”, Fig. 1) of approximately 25×25×25 cm dug manually. Each hole
received one beneficiary community. The holes benefiting from the nurse plant
effect (hereafter named “nurse patch”) were located below the canopy of the
benefactor, about 20 cm apart from the main stem of the plant, and oriented
northward to maximise the shading effect. Each nurse received one hole only
(i.e. one beneficiary community). One week before planting saplings, the area
received about 40 mm of natural rainfall (affecting all terraces equally), which
provided excellent initial moisture conditions for the planted saplings. The
holes were randomly attributed to the different treatments. The saplings
composing the beneficiary communities were about 6 months at the time of
transplantation and were grown in the open air in a nursery located 30 km from
the study site (Viveros Muzalé S.L., Abanilla, Spain). They were grown in
controlled wet conditions in 200 ml containers with a mixture of peat and
coconut fibre, containing several individuals of the same species. Plants were
bought in small pots. We planted three pots per hole, following a triangular
arrangement in which the plant pots were equally distant from each other
(approximately 10 cm). To exclude the initial variation in the number of
individuals per microsite, we only considered holes in which at least one
individual from the original container survived in January, and removed
supernumerary individuals by cutting their stems at their basis.

In order to estimate the total biomass of the beneficiary plants during the
course of the experiment, we estimated the allometric relationship linking total
biomass to basal diameter and maximal height with a species effect
[@catchpole_estimating_1992; @nafus_multispecies_2009]. We put aside twelve
individuals of each species in November (i.e. at the time we collected the
seedlings from the nursery), and dried them at 65°C for three days to assess the
total biomass of each individual. We log-transformed total biomass, basal
diameter and vegetative height prior to modelling. The R² of the model was quite
high ($R^2$ = `r r2bm["R2"]`, adjusted $R^2$ = `r r2bm["adj"]`), and we found a
good agreement between predicted and observed values (Fig. S2, see estimated
coefficients in Table S1). This allometric relationship provided an estimation
of total plant biomass based on the non-lethal measurement of plant height and
stem diameter in the field (considering either only basal diameter or estimated
total biomass did not alter our conclusions, see Fig. S3). Basal diameter was
measured using a digital caliper at around 1 cm above the ground. To increase
accuracy of the repeated measurements on the same plant, (1) we left a mark at
the exact place where the first basal diameter measurement was taken and (2)
measurements were done on the same side of the stem. Maximum height was measured
using a measuring tape as the vertical distance between the soil and the top
leafed stem. During the experiment, we measured the performance of individual
beneficiary plants by recording (1) their survival and (2) their total biomass
(using the above allometric relationship) from January to October 2016 (10
months).

To better understand the underlying mechanism through which nurse plants affect
the beneficiary communities, we analysed how  leaf functional traits responded
to experimental treatments among beneficiaries. We focused on two leaf traits
known to reflect different resource acquisition strategies: Leaf Dry Matter
Content (LDMC) and Specific Leaf Area [SLA, @perez-harguindeguy_new_2013]. The
leaves of beneficiary plants were collected and processed in March 2016 (4
months after plantation) following guidelines from @perez-harguindeguy_new_2013.
We only collected leaves without traces of disease, grazing or senescence, that
were mature and most exposed to sunlight (i.e. close to the top
of the main stem). We collected a small number of leaves, and only from the most
healthy individuals, as to minimise the effect of leaf sampling on their
response to experimental conditions. We collected 3 leaves per plant for *P.
lentiscus*, 5 leaves for *A. citisoides* and 10 leaves for *D. pentaphyllum*, so that
the overall dry leaf biomass of each sample was sufficient for weighing. Leaves
from each individual were stored in a plastic tube with a humid tissue to limit
desiccation and stored in thermally-isolated cooler for transportation. Leaves
were then first rehydrated with deionised water for several minutes, weighed,
scanned, and then dried at least 48h at 72°C. Once dry, we weighed individual
leaves to compute LDMC and SLA. We a priori selected a random subset of
microsites to be sampled, and then we effectively sampled only the subset that
met the above conditions to reach a minimal sampling size per treatment
combination of 7 samples for SLA (max 36) and 13 samples for LDMC (max 75, Table
S2).

## Data analysis {-}

Data analyses comprised two steps. We first modelled the survival, the biomass,
and the leaf functional traits of the beneficiary communities to assess the
effects of experimental treatments. We then used the predicted values of
survival and biomass to compute the net effects of the nurse on beneficiary
communities, and used the predicted values of biomass to compute complementarity
and selection effects.

### Modelling survival and biomass of beneficiary communities {-}


We used mixed-effect generalised linear models to test whether the presence of
the nurse affected the performance of beneficiary communities, i.e. their total
biomass and their survival, for different levels of species richness
(monoculture or mix of three species) and water stress. The presence of the
nurse, the species richness of the beneficiary communities and the watering
treatment were set as fixed effects. Because we hypothesised that the nurse
effect on beneficiary communities was modulated by water stress level and the
richness of the beneficiary communities, we included the two-way and three-way
interactions.

We further accounted for the following sources of variation via additional fixed
effects: species identity of the beneficiary communities, time in months since
the start of the experiment, and terrace identity. We added an extra quadratic
effect of time as a fixed effect in the biomass model as it was found to
decrease after summer. We further accounted for pseudoreplication linked to
repeated measurements of the same beneficiary community across time by
considering microsite level variation (i.e. hole containing the beneficiary
communities nested within the terrace level) by specifying a random effect with
these terms (Table S3).

All models were fit using a Bayesian framework. We fit the biomass response
variable with a gaussian error structure and the survival response variable with
a binomial one with a logit link function. We used the Integrated Nested
Laplacian Approximation (INLA) to fit models [@rue_approximate_2009;
@rue_bayesian_2017] based on the INLA R package [@rue_approximate_2009], with
default uninformative priors. The prior distribution of fixed coefficients
followed a flat, zero centred, normal distribution ($\mathcal{N}(\mu,\,
\sigma^2) = \mathcal{N}(0,\, 1000)$). The prior distribution of the random
effects and the gaussian error followed a log gamma distribution with shape and
inverse scale parameters ($\mathcal{G}(s, \, \tau) = \mathcal{G}(1, \,
5.10^-5)$). We then back-transformed the estimated coefficients to the standard
deviations attributed to the random effects and the gaussian error ($\sigma = 1
/ \sqrt{\tau}$). We computed the credible intervals for each model parameters at
80%, 90% and 95% using the Highest Posterior Density method
[@hyndman_computing_1996], which can respectively be interpreted as weak,
moderate and strong evidence of an effect when the interval does not include 0
[@mastrandrea_guidance_2010; @van_klink_meta-analysis_2020].

We checked the overall quality of the model fit to the data visually by plotting
the fitted versus the observed values (Fig. S4, Table S4). We visually inspected
the PIT and CPO (respectively Posterior Integral Transform and Conditional
Predictive Ordinate) distribution to assess both the quality of data
representation and the frequency of outliers.

### Estimates of nurse net effects on survival and biomass of beneficiary communities {-}


We used the statistical models above to obtain a prediction of plant biomass and
survival probability through time for all treatments, which we used to compute
summary indices of interactions. The net effect of the nurse-beneficiary
interactions was estimated with the additive Neighbor-effect Intensity index
[NIntA, @diaz-sierra_new_2016]. Positive values indicate positive net effects
of the nurse on beneficiary communities (i.e. facilitation), while negative
values indicate net negative effects of the nurse (i.e. competition). We used
this index instead of the more-commonly used RII because the NIntA displays
additive symmetry, i.e. positive and negative effects of the same magnitude are
captured by opposite values (e.g. +10/-10), which avoids the underestimation of
facilitation compared to competition [@diaz-sierra_new_2016]. The NIntA is
computed as follows:

\begin{equation}
    NInt_A = 2 \frac{ \Delta P }{P_{-N} + |\Delta P|}
    (\#eq:int)
\end{equation}

with ($P_{-N}$) the performance of the beneficiary species in open microsites
and ($\Delta P$) the difference between the performance of beneficiary species
in nurse patches and in open microsites (i.e. $P_{+N} - P_{-N}$). We used the
sampled distribution of predicted values of survival and biomass (N = 1000
sampling) to compute the mean and the credible intervals at 80% of the NintA
index.

### Nurse effects on the functional traits of beneficiary species


Using the same statistical models as above (i.e. fixed effect of water
treatment, presence/absence of nurse and species richness of beneficiary
communities, along with their interactions), we assessed the effects of
experimental treatments on both LDMC and SLA. These models did not include time
as a fixed effect as functional traits were measured only once.

### Nurse effects on complementarity and competitive hierarchy in beneficiary communities

We estimated how experimental treatments affected net diversity effects on
beneficiary biomass and its partition into complementarity and selection. We
used the same statistical model as for biomass, in which we added an interaction
term between species effect and experimental treatments in order to estimate the
differential responses of species to treatments, which is necessary to estimate
selection effects. We used the model predictions for biomass to estimate how
nurse affects complementarity and competitive hierarchy (i.e. selection effects)
in beneficiary communities [@loreau_partitioning_2001]. The complementarity effect
measures whether species in diverse communities have higher or lower biomass
than expected from monoculture. A negative complementarity effect reflects a
prevalence of competitive interference in beneficiary communities, while
positive values indicate the prevalence of resource use partitioning or
facilitation among beneficiary species. Complementarity effects were computed as
the species richness times the average species relative biomass change from
monoculture to mixture times the average species biomass in monoculture.
Selection effects assess changes in species dominance in the beneficiary
communities. Positive selection effects indicate that species that have the
highest performance (here, measured as biomass) in monoculture are the ones that
have the highest relative gain in biomass in mixture and reversely, meaning that
the species that produce the most biomass in monoculture are the competitively
dominant. Negative selection effects indicate that species that have the highest
biomass in monoculture also have the lowest biomass gain in diverse communities,
meaning that the species that are the most productive in monoculture are poor
competitors [@fargione_selection_2007]. Finally, neutral selection effects reflect
an absence of relationship between species performance in monoculture and in
mixture, indicating an absence of competitive dominance. Selection effects were
computed as the species richness (i.e. 3) times the covariance between the
species relative biomass change from monoculture to mixture and the species
biomass in monoculture. As for NIntA computation, we used the biomass predicted
from the statistical model to compute the diversity net effects, complementarity
and selection effects, along with their 80% credible intervals.

## Effects of the nurse on the survival and biomass of beneficiary communities


We found no effect of the presence of the nurse alone on the survival and
biomass of monospecific beneficiary communities (survival odd-ratio = `r s_m`,
Fig. \@ref(fig:sbm)a; biomass: $\beta$ = `r b_m`, Fig. \@ref(fig:sbm)b),
resulting in an overall slight negative net effect of the nurse in monospecific
beneficiary communities (Fig. \@ref(fig:sbm)c, d, red and blue points).

We further found that, in open microsites, the species in diverse beneficiary communities had
the same survival (OR = `r s_c`, Fig. \@ref(fig:sbm)a) but lower biomass
($\beta$ = `r b_c`, Fig. \@ref(fig:sbm)b) than monospecific communities.
Watering increased the survival and biomass of beneficiary communities in open
microsites (survival: OR = `r s_w`, biomass: $\beta$ = `r b_w`), and this effect
was enhanced in diverse beneficiary communities (survival: OR = `r s_wc`,
biomass: $\beta$ = `r b_wc`). The positive watering effect on survival and
biomass in monospecific beneficiary communities was similar regardless of the
presence or absence of the nurse (survival: OR = `r s_wm`, biomass: $\beta$ =
`r b_wm`), resulting in near-neutral net effects of the nurse on monospecific
beneficiary communities in watered and non-watered treatments (Fig. \@ref(fig:sbm)c & d, red and
blue points).

Diverse beneficiary communities under nurses had higher survival and biomass
than monospecific beneficiary communities in the same conditions (strong support
for survival, OR = `r s_cm`, Fig. \@ref(fig:sbm)a, and weak support for biomass
$\beta$ = `r b_cm`, Fig. \@ref(fig:sbm)b), resulting in a strong positive net effect
of the nurse in diverse and non watered assemblages (Fig. \@ref(fig:sbm)c & d, red
triangle). However, the positive effects of nurses on the survival and the
biomass of diverse beneficiary communities were reduced by  watering (survival:
OR = `r s_wcm`, Fig. \@ref(fig:sbm)a; biomass: $\beta$ = `r b_wcm`, Fig.
\@ref(fig:sbm)b), resulting in a negative net effect of the nurse in diverse and
watered beneficiary communities (Fig. \@ref(fig:sbm)c & d, blue triangle).

## Effect of the nurse on the traits of the beneficiaries

We found that functional traits of the beneficiary communities responded
similarly to the nurses and watering treatments (nurse and water alone in Fig.
\@ref(fig:lt)). The Leaf Dry Matter Content (LDMC) and Specific Leaf Area (SLA)
of the beneficiary communities were found to respond to nurse patch and watering
treatments. We found that beneficiary communities located under nurses had a
higher SLA and lower LDMC than in open areas (Standardised coefficients: $\beta$
= `r l_m` and `r a_m` respectively, Fig. \@ref(fig:lt)). We further found strong
evidence for lower LDMC in watered treatment ($\beta$ = `r l_w`) but not SLA
($\beta$ = `r a_w`). We did not find evidence that community diversity affected
leaf traits (Fig. \@ref(fig:lt)).

```{r, eval = FALSE}

We found that soil moisture was quite low, 7.25% on average in March and that
watering increased soil moisture by 4.24% 16 hours after watering (i.e. +58% in
March, Fig. S1, Table S1). However, nurse patches were not found to result in
higher soil moisture overall (4.0 95%CI:[3.1, 4.9] in nurse patch vs 4.0 [3.1,
4.9] in open non-watered microsites in June, Fig. S1). We found that nurse patches had a
temperature 3 celsius degrees lower than in the open at noon (32.3 [31.2, 33.5]
vs 28.9
[27.6, 30.1] in June, i.e. -11%, Fig. S1), and a Photosynthetic Active
Radiation 100 Quantum.m^-2.s^-1 lower than in the open (255 [229, 280] vs 358
[333, 383] in June, i.e. -29%, Fig. S1).

## Effects of the nurse on complementarity and competitive hierarchy

Partitioning the effects of species richness on the biomass of beneficiary
communities, we found that the presence of the nurse interacted with water
stress level to determine complementarity and selection effects (Fig. \@ref(fig:div)). We
always found positive net effects of species diversity on beneficiary biomass,
driven by positive complementarity effects, contrasting with overall low
selection effects. Without watering, complementarity
increased under nurses compared to open microsites (Fig. \@ref(fig:div), red lines),
indicating that the nurse promotes the positive effects of species richness.
Conversely, with watering, increase in complementarity was higher in open
microsites than under nurse patches. In open microsites, the increase in
complementarity effects was much larger for watered beneficiary communities than
for non-watered ones (Fig. \@ref(fig:div), rounded points), while watering hardly increased
complementarity in nurse patches (Fig. \@ref(fig:div), triangular points). We further found
that watering increased selection effects from slightly negative to slightly
positive in open microsites (-.25 vs .5,Fig. \@ref(fig:div), rounded points), while watering
had no effect on selection in nurse patches (triangle points). In nurse patches,
selection effects were negative regardless of the water stress conditions
(around -.1, Fig. \@ref(fig:div)), indicating that nurse plants altered competitive
dominance in beneficiary communities.

# Discussion {-}

One of the key questions about the role of facilitation buffering the impacts of
drought and climate change in dryland communities is how the species diversity
of beneficiary communities mediates facilitation and its effects.  We examined
the role of beneficiary species diversity with a manipulative field experiment
that allowed us to ask three key questions: 1) How does species richness affect
nurse net effects on survival and biomass? 2) How do nurse plants alter the
water stress of beneficiary communities?, and 3) How do nurse plants affect
complementarity and competitive hierarchy in beneficiary communities? Overall, we
found that nurse facilitation only occurred in case of species diverse
beneficiary communities and in the absence of watering. Nurse and watering
treatments had similar effects on complementarity (gain in biomass in
diverse beneficiary communities compared to monoculture) and on the traits of
beneficiaries. However, the nurse treatment differed from watering in its effect
on competitive hierarchy, as nurse maintained quasi-neutral selection effects. Here
we review our results in the wider context of global change research in drylands
and previous work on facilitation and ecological theory.


## Species richness and water stress determine nurse effects on survival and biomass of beneficiary communities

We found that nurses had weak and quasi-neutral net effects on the survival and
biomass of monospecific beneficiary communities, regardless of the level of
water stress. This result could be explained by a
strong intraspecific competition among the 3 beneficiary individuals in
monoculture that swamps the positive effects of the presence of the nurse. Those results are in line
with the meta-analysis reporting that intraspecific competition is several orders
of magnitude higher than interspecific competition [@adler_competition_2018].
This is also aligned with coexistence theory that predicts strong competition
among conspecific plants due to the absence of niche differences
[@chesson_general_2000; @kraft_plant_2015], and this effect appeared to
supersede the effect of nursing, regardless of the water treatment. Our results
suggest that accounting for competition among beneficiary species is one
important factor to understand the effects of nursing on beneficiary communities
[@schob_direct_2013; @michalet_disentangling_2015].


In contrast with monospecific beneficiary communities, we found that the nurse
had strong positive effects on plant survival and biomass in diverse beneficiary
communities in unwatered conditions. This positive effect of nursing in mixture
in absence of watering could then be held by the lower competition experienced
by the beneficiary species in the mixture communities, thereby the facilitation
provided by the nurse exceeds the competition among beneficiary species. It
resonates with coexistence theory stating that niche differentiation is key to
achieve stable coexistence [@chesson_general_2000]. However, the positive effect
of the nurse in mixture shifted to a negative effect in watered conditions, in
accordance with the numerous studies showing that nurse-beneficiary net
interactions shift from positive in stressful environments to negative in more
benign environments [@bertness_positive_1994; @callaway_positive_2007;
@graff_species_2017]. This shift toward a negative effect of the nurse could be
held by two processes: watering improved the performance of beneficiaries in
open microsites, but nurses were more efficient than beneficiary plants in
consuming the added water in patch microsites through a more developed rooting
system [@aguiar_competition_1994; @maestre_positive_2003]. Many dryland species quickly respond to
water pulses, yet the differences in size and associated capacity for water
uptake between an adult nurse plant and its neighbour saplings could explain
that watering primarily benefited the nurse plant [@morcillo_interacting_2022],
even resulting, as in our study, in negative net effects between the nurse and
beneficiary communities.


## Effects of nurse on functional traits

We found that beneficiary communities followed less resource-conservative
strategy (or a more resource-exploitative strategy) when being watered or in a
nurse patch than when being not watered or in open sites. More specifically, we
found that the LDMC of beneficiary communities decreased in watered microsites
and in nurse patch microsites. At a broader scale, LDMC has been found to
decrease  with increasing annual rainfall [@borgy_plant_2017]. Our results
suggest that we can draw a parallel between the effects of being under a nurse
and the increase in water resources, could be both related to lower water
deficit. We further found an increase in the Specific Leaf Area of beneficiary
communities in nurse patch sites, which might indicate as well the development
of a less resource conservative strategy in nurse patches
[@galmes_modulation_2005; @zhang_mechanisms_2015]. Another explanation is that
decrease in LDMC and increase in SLA in nurse patches might be due to the
shading effect of the nurse. Indeed, light reduction and shading can induce a
compensation for the limited amount of radiation received and a common
adaptation for understory plants [@pons_ecophysiological_1977;
@ackerly_leaf_2002; @liu_does_2016; @yang_effects_2019]. We did not find that
watering affects the SLA of beneficiary communities in open sites, but led to
lower LDMC. It suggests that the response of leaf traits to the decrease of
water stress in open sites did not imply leaf area, maybe because of the higher
evapotranspiration in open sites, which might in turn promote the maintenance of
the same specific leaf area (i.e. same SLA) despite less water stress. Overall,
our results are consistent with previous results showing that decrease in water
stress results in plant plastic responses toward higher SLA and lower LDMC
[@galmes_modulation_2005; @zhang_mechanisms_2015; @jung_intraspecific_2014, but
see @majekova_weak_2021]. However, the direct measurement of plant physiology
activity would be necessary to conclude more definitively on the link between
nurse presence, water stress and plant strategy. We did not find an effect of
the species richness of beneficiary communities on average LDMC and SLA.
It might be because functional traits are expected to respond to variations in
species richness in terms of trait variance and overlap [@violle_return_2012;
@danet_effects_2018] rather than in average values, which are expected to
respond to environmental changes as we found in the present study
[@enquist_scaling_2015; @danet_nurse_2017].

## Nurse increases complementarity effects in beneficiary communities

Our results also provide insights on how species richness effects were
partitioned in complementarity and selection effects. We found consistent net
positive effects of species richness on beneficiary community biomass, driven by
positive complementarity effects, contrasting with overall low selection
effects. Overall, diversity net effects associated with selection were very low
compared to complementarity effects, a result similar to previous findings in
grasslands [@loreau_partitioning_2001; @fargione_selection_2007]. It indicates
the positive effects of species richness on biomass are held by complementary
effects rather than selection, suggesting that the processes linked to niche
differentiation and facilitation play a more important role than the ones linked
to competitive dominance. We further found that
watering increased complementarity effects in open sites and that nurse
increased complementarity effects in no watered sites, indicating again that there
is a parallel between the effect in resource increase and nursing effects. We
further found that in watered sites, the nurse did not increase complementarity
effects in beneficiary communities compared to open sites, which can be related
with the negative net effects of nurse on biomass found in watered diverse
beneficiary communities.

However, we found that low water stress led to positive selection
effects in open sites (compared to quasi neutral selection effects at low water
stress level), i.e. that species that had higher biomass in monoculture had the
higher biomass in diverse beneficiary communities. This result indicates that
alleviation of water stress by watering results in the competitive dominance of
species that have the higher biomass in monoculture, while higher water stress
in control conditions suppresses this competitive dominance. It agrees with
previous findings showing that even small changes in environmental conditions
can result in a shift in the competitive hierarchy among species [@hillerislambers_how_2013;
@alexander_when_2016; @van_dyke_small_2022].
The negative selection effects found in nurse patches regardless of the
water stress indicate that species that had the lower biomass in monoculture had
the higher increase in biomass in mixture, suggesting that the more maladapted
species benefited the most from being in a nurse patch. It resonates with
earlier findings showing that nurse plants can change the competitive hierarchy
of beneficiary species [@schob_direct_2013; @michalet_disentangling_2015]
and that mal-adapted species are the most facilitated species
[@liancourt_stress_2005; @graff_species_2017]. Hence the use of nurse
plants, might be a key to maintain the positive effects of biodiversity on
ecosystem functioning by buffering  environmental stochasticity in environments
that in environments that are expected to experience more and more extreme
environmental variations [@jiang_importance_2008; @wright_overlooked_2017].

## Facilitation potential to mitigate climate change effects on biodiversity

Our results show that the facilitation provided by nurse plants can improve the
performance of species diverse beneficiary communities in water stress condition
by increasing biomass and survival, lead to changes in leaf functional traits
toward less water stress syndrome, increase the complementarity effects (i.e.
niche differentiation and facilitation) in beneficiary communities while
facilitating more the most maladapted species (i.e. negative selection effects)
of species regardless of the water stress. Furthermore, our results show that
the nurse effect is similar to the effect of adding water to open sites (on
functional traits and complementarity effects). Altogether, the results suggest
that facilitation by nurse shrubs can promote diversity of beneficiary
communities under high water deficit by increasing survival, which points to its
importance to maintaining biodiversity in a climate change context. Secondly,
our study also suggests that nurse shrubs can promote the species richness
effects on biomass production. The potential of using facilitation as a
potential restoration tool in drylands largely depends on the nurse and the
beneficiary target species [@fagundes_nurse-target_2022]. However,
according to our results, facilitation by nurse shrubs could help to establish
species-rich transplanted communities by increasing the potential for niche
differentiation and facilitation among beneficiary species. However, if nurses
come to be impacted by climate change and/or targeted by land-use change, then
we could expect dramatic cascading effects in drylands communities
[@losapio_resistance_2017].

# Conclusion and perspectives

Our study suffers from some limits that might impede its generalisability. Here,
diverse beneficiary communities were only composed of three species, which is a
relatively low number of species compared to natural dryland communities, and we
used a nurse plant, *Artemisia herba-alba*, which is known to produce phytotoxic
compounds [@arroyo_phytotoxic_2018]; different results might be expected with a less
inhibitory nurse plants. Another limit of our experiment is that it only lasts
for one year because most saplings have died after the first summer. Therefore,
predictions of nursing effects over a longer time are difficult to estimate,
such as longer time scales might change effects of the nurse on complementarity
and selection effects in beneficiary communities [@fargione_selection_2007]. However,
our study reports a major role of the species richness of the  beneficiary
communities in driving nurse net effects on survival and biomass. It indicates
that facilitation of beneficiary communities are more likely to happen to
species diverse communities. Furthermore, our study shows that facilitation can
maintain high complementarity effects and low selection effects despite water
stress. Then, our study opens new perspectives on how facilitation acts on
species diverse communities and contributes to integrate facilitation more
explicitly into biodiversity and ecosystem functioning concepts.
