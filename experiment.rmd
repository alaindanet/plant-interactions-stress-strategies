# Plantation

## Site 

The plantation was going during three weeks from the ... to the ...  of November.

  - To add: photos

## The holes

We re-used the holes which were used in a precedent experiment (Werviejmeren et al., in prep). Those have a size of $25 cm$ by $25 cm$ by $25 cm$ and were dug using a drilling machine. We selected only the holes where Artemisia were alive. Where it missed some holes, we dug some by ourself using picks.

# Allometric mesurements

After the plantation, we used 12 remaining saplings by species to do allometric measurements and measure functional traits. 

## Protocol

There was several individuals in each pot and their number were variable. Thus, we select the biggest stem to do our measurements. We measured the height of the stem, 2 measurements perpandicular of basal diameter and the Huber index (basal diameter without the bark). After this, the stem, the leaves and the roots were separated and dried at 65°C during 3 days to obtain the biomass. Before to be dried, the leaves were scanned to calculate the Specific Leaf Area.

## Allometry between basal diameter, height and biomass

```{r allometry, echo = FALSE , fig.caption="Relationship between different biomass part and basal diameter. Black: stem biomass, brown: root biomass, green: leaves biomass"}

data <- read.table("biomass_t0.csv", sep=";", dec=",", header=T)

par(pch=20, mfrow=c(1,2))
variable <- c("dia2", "height")        #Explicative variables
for (i in 1:length(variable)) {
	plot(data[, "bio_stem"] ~ data[, variable[i]],
	xlab="Basal diameter (mm)", ylab="Biomass (g)"#,
# 	main= "Relationship between biomass and basal diameter"
	)
	points(data[, "bio_roots"] ~ data[, variable[i]], col="brown")
	points(data[, "bio_leaves"] ~ data[, variable[i]], col="green")
}

# Plantation results

## Distribution of the holes

The goal of this part is to look if there were some mistakes during the holes attributions.
Let's see the distribution of the holes by treatments.

```{r, results="hide"}
data <- read.table("data_january_transplant_shock.csv", sep=";",dec=",", header=T)
str(data)
data$ms <- as.factor(data$ms)
```

```{r}
att <- tapply(data$com, list(data$ms, data$com), length)
att <- as.matrix(att)
colnames(att) <- c("Anthyllis", "Dorycnium", "Mixture", "Pistachia")
rownames(att) <- c("Open","Patch")
```

```{r plant_plot, fig.height=5, fig.width=7}
barplot(as.matrix(att), beside=TRUE,
	col=c("white", "black"), 
	names.arg= c("Anthyllis", "Dorycnium", "Mixture", "Pistachia"),
	main="Number of holes distributed by treatments",
	ylim=c(0,100))
text(x = c(1.50, 2.50, 4.5, 5.5, 7.5, 8.5, 10.5, 11.5),
	y = as.vector(att + 5),
	labels = as.character(as.vector(att)))
text(x = c(1.50, 2.50, 4.5, 5.5, 7.5, 8.5, 10.5, 11.5),
	y = as.vector(3), labels = c("Open", "Patch"),
	col = c("black" ,"white"))
```

## Transplantation shock

The first measurements were done from the 11th to the 16th January. We measured the height, the basal diameter and the state of the saplings. Those measurements represent the starting of the experiment. We will keep only the holes in which all the individuals are alive because those individuals can be dead because of the transplant and so, not because of the treatments.

To investigate the state of the saplings, we set up an index to characterize the state of the saplings (NOTE: find how to do a table in markdown). 

 - 0/nothing: plant in a good shape, totally green
 - 1: plant with some leaves which are not green
 - 2: plant with all leaves which are not green
 - 3: plant dead

```{r transplant_result, echo = FALSE}

data <- read.table("data_january_transplant_shock2.csv", sep=";",dec=",", header=T)

data[c("state")][is.na(data[c("state")])] <- 0
	
tra <- data[data$state<=2,]
art <- tapply(tra$com, list(tra$ms, tra$com), length)
art <- as.matrix(art)
colnames(art) <- c("Anthyllis", "Dorycnium", "Mixture", "Pistachia")
rownames(art) <- c("Open","Patch")
knitr::kable(art, caption="Number of holes with individuals in good shape")
```

```{r transplant_plot, fig.height=5, fig.width=7}
art <- tapply(tra$e3, list(tra$ms, tra$com), mean)
art <- as.matrix(art)

barplot(as.matrix(art), beside=TRUE,
	col=c("white", "black"), 
	names.arg= c("Anthyllis", "Dorycnium", "Mixture", "Pistachia"),
	main="Number of holes distributed by treatments with good individuals",
	ylim=c(0,1))
text(x = c(1.50, 2.50, 4.5, 5.5, 7.5, 8.5, 10.5, 11.5),
	y = as.vector(art + 5),
	labels = as.character(as.vector(art)))
text(x = c(1.50, 2.50, 4.5, 5.5, 7.5, 8.5, 10.5, 11.5),
	y = as.vector(3), labels = c("Open", "Patch"),
	col = c("black" ,"white"))
```

```{r transplant_plot2, fig.height=5, fig.width=7}
barplot(as.matrix(art), beside=TRUE,
	col=c("white", "black"), 
	names.arg= c("Anthyllis", "Dorycnium", "Mixture", "Pistachia"),
	main="Number of holes distributed by treatments with good individuals",
	ylim=c(0,100))
text(x = c(1.50, 2.50, 4.5, 5.5, 7.5, 8.5, 10.5, 11.5),
	y = as.vector(art + 5),
	labels = as.character(as.vector(art)))
text(x = c(1.50, 2.50, 4.5, 5.5, 7.5, 8.5, 10.5, 11.5),
	y = as.vector(3), labels = c("Open", "Patch"),
	col = c("black" ,"white"))
```

### Distribution of the transplant shock by terrace

## Measurements

We recorded the vegetative height and the basal diameter of the plants. Let's see the summary results. The vegetation height was measured as a light competitive trait. It means that we measured the plants without moving them. Note: Susana suggested that the length of the stem would be more relevant ( calculate height/basal diameter to know the growth strategies of the plants)

```{r first_measure, echo = FALSE }
layout(matrix(c(1,2,3,4,5,6), 2, 3, byrow = FALSE))

com <- c("A", "D", "P")
for (i in 1:3) {
	hist(data[which(data$com==com[i]),]$h1, breaks=20, main=paste(com[i]," ","heights"), xlab="")
	hist(data[which(data$com==com[i]),]$d1, breaks=20, main=paste(com[i]," ","diameters"), xlab="")
}
for (i in 1:3) {
	hist(data[which(data$com==com[i]),]$height, breaks=20, main=paste(com[i]," ","heights"), xlab="")
	hist(data[which(data$com==com[i]),]$diameter, breaks=20, main=paste(com[i]," ","diameters"), xlab="")
}
```

## Hole selection for the watering treatment

For the transplantation shock, we saw that it is cleary unbalanced among treatments. We will select the holes that will be watered by selecting half of the holes whose all the plants have a score below than 2. We can that the watering treatment is almost distributed equally in each other treatments combination.

```{r water_plot_selection, echo = FALSE, eval=FALSE }
sampled <- data[data$e1<=2 & data$e2<=2 & data$e3<=2,]
sampl <- c()
for (i in 1:nlevels(sampled$com)) {
	for (j in 1:nlevels(sampled$ms)) {
		temp <- sampled[which(sampled$com==levels(sampled$com)[i] & sampled$ms==levels(sampled$ms)[j]),]$label
		sampl <- c(sampl, sample(temp, size= round(length(temp)/2), replace=FALSE))
	}
}

sampled$watering <- rep(0,times=length(sampled$label))
sampled[which(sampled$label %in% sampl),]$watering <- 1
tabl <- tapply(sampled$watering, list(sampled$ms, sampled$com), FUN= function(x) sum(x)/length(x))
tabl <- round(tabl,3)
knitr::kable(tabl, caption="fraction of holes which will be watered by treatments")
```
The new file with only the holes remaining in the experiment and the distribution of the watering treatment replaced the previous file. *NOTE: the different versions of the file were commited and taged in git.*

## Error check in the data

We did some logic tests to detect mistakes in the dataset. The code of those test can be found in the source of this file.
```{r error_check, echo = FALSE, eval=FALSE}
data <- read.table("data_january_plant.csv", sep=";",dec=",", header=T)

# Check if the species correspond to the community attribute 
ck <- c()
for (i in 1:length(data$com)) {
	if ( data[i,]$com=="D" ) 
	{ 
		ck[i] <- data[i,]$sp1=="dorycnium"
	}
	if ( data[i,]$com=="P" ) 
	{ 
		ck[i] <- data[i,]$sp1=="pistachia"
	}
	if ( data[i,]$com=="A" ) 
	{ 
		ck[i] <- data[i,]$sp1=="anthyllis"
	}
	if ( data[i,]$com=="M" ) 
	{ 
		ck[i] <- NA
	}
}
which(ck==FALSE)

# check if all the dead are recorded
ck <- c()
for (i in 1:length(data$label)) {
	if ( any(is.na(as.vector(data[i,c("h1","h2","h3", "d1", "d2", "d3")])))) 
	{ 
		ck[i] <- any(as.vector(data[i,c("e1", "e2", "e3")])==3) 
	} else { ck[i] <- NA} 
}
which(ck==FALSE)

for (i in 1:length(data[data$com=="M",]$label)) {
	if ( any(is.na(data[data$com=="M",c("sp1","sp2","sp3")][i,]))) 
	{ 
		ck[i] <- as.vector(data[data$com=="M",]$label[i])
	}else{ 
		ck[i] <- 0

	}

}


```

# Environmental measurements


Due to the holes selection for the treatments, some probes were not included in the measurements. The measurements of soil moisture were taken during the morning between 9 and 11 january, the PAR and the temperature between 13h30 and 15h. The measurements took place from wenesday 20 to friday 22th january (3 days). We watered one terrace by day and we did the measurements the day after the watering.

# Functional traits analysis


## Protocol

### Field

We will mesure functional traits during the month of march. We will measure Specific Leaf Area, $\delta C^{13}$, leaf height and leaf width.
We will collect one leaf by individual. Each leaf will be stored in Falcon tubes filled with distilled water.
Those falcon tubes will be stored in glacial boxes.

### Lab

When the leaves will be taken from the tubes, we will first remove the excess water. Following this, we will weight, scan, measure them, put them in an enveloppe, and finally put them in the drier. 



## Material

- 640 enveloppes
- 500 falcon tubes
- 4 glacial boxes (180 tubes by glacial boxes)
- plastic bags
- scissors

## Cost

### Leaves analyses

- $\delta C^{13}$: 7.5\$ per sample.
