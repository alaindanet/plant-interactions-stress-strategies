\part{Introduction}
The theory of Stress Gradient Hypothesis (SGH) predict basicly a increasing of facilitation importance when stress increase. This hypothesis has been widely tested and stay still in debate because of opposite results. Two of main obstacles are (i) the fact all the species have not the same potential to be facilited and conversely all the species have not the same potentiel to facilitate; (ii) We have not the same assumptions if the "stress" is based on stress (eg water) or disturbance (eg grazing) (sensu Grime).

As \citet{Butterfield2013} suggested, take a functional approach of facilitation will permit us to better understand the context dependance of facilitation. He predicts stress would result in facilitation of competitive species and disturbance would result in facilitation of competitive or stress-tolerator species. So far, we don't know any experimental studies which have explicitly related Grime plant strategies to SGH. On the other hand, some observational studies described plant strategies along grazing gradient \citep{DIAZ2007}.

The conceptual model of Grime predict the dominant plant strategies along stress and disturbance gradient (Competitive, Stress-tolerator and Ruderals) and SGH predict importance of interaction type along stress and disturbance gradient.

\end{figure}



The goal of this studies is to have a functional approach of interaction inside a plant community in front of stress and disturbance gradient.

%%conceptual link between Grime and SGH model: (i) Facilitation can modulate Grime predictions ? (ii) Which strategies is the most facilitated along a stress and disturbance gradient ?

\part{Methods}

\section{Site}

The experiment will take in Alicante. Mart's field sites are free to use and those sites seem perfect.

\section{Plants}

It seems difficult to me to find caricatural species of grime's strategies but we can use instead species already used in experimental studies located in Mediteranean area.
I used studies of \citep{McCluney2012,Navarro2006, Jauffret2003}

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline 
Vrac & Grazing tolerant & Grazing sensitive & Stress-tolerant & Competitive \\ 
\hline 
Teucrium polium & Fagonia cretica & Phlomis purpurea & \textit{Helianthemum squamatum} & \textit{Stipa tenacissima} \\ 
\hline 
Koeleria vallesiana & Paronichia sufruticosa & Cistus albidus & • & \textit{Ligeum spartum} \\ 
\hline 
Thymus lacaitae & Thymus & Quercus coccifera  & \textit{Lepidium subulatum} & • \\ 
\hline 
Herniaria fruticosa & Teucrium & Olea europaea & \textit{Retama sphaerocarpa} & • \\ 
\hline
 & Sideritis spp. & • & \textit{Pistacia lentiscus} & • \\ 
\hline
 & A. herba-alba & • &  & • \\ 
\hline
\end{tabular} 


\section{Design}

We have 3 plant species. I purposed a set of species to Susana and we have to decided which can be used. We have 4 treatments: open/patch, grazing, water supply/water stress, alone/community.

Each species will be plant alone and in mix with the 2 other species. We will simulate grazing instead of use goat. It will permit us to scale statistical unit to micro-site instead of plot as in previous experiment 
We will have a water-stress treatment provided by Susana's roof which exclude a bit less than 30\% of rainfall or if the summer is very dry, we can watering instead of exclude to have the water treatment.

\caption{Experiment. Circle: adults; Square: saplings. Saplings are planted in triangular way and position is random in the triangle. \label{exp}}
\end{figure}

Table \ref{hyp} shows assumptions about results of winning strategies according to stress or disturbance. In Summary, (i) we can think facilitation modulate Grime's prediction, (ii) we also make hypothesis that different strategies have different potential to be facilited.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
  \hline
  & Control & Water stress & Low grazing & High grazing  \\
  \hline
  Patch & C & C & C & R \\
  \hline
  Open & C & S & S ou R & R \\
  \hline
\end{tabular} 
\end{center}
\caption{Hypothesis about winning plant strategies according to stress or disturbance.  Strategies: C (Competitive), R (Ruderal), S (Stress-tolerator). \label{hyp}}
\end{table}

\section{Measurements}
It would be good to measure height canopy and survival regularly to have dynamics of competition. Finally, the final output of competition would be an idea of seed production.


\section{Timing}
\begin{itemize}

\item End January: Drill hole.
\item February: plant saplings, watering them to prevent transplant mortality.
\item March: .
\item June or july: may be one visit to make sure everything is fine and water plants.
\item October: first measure and after application of grazing and water treatment.
\item March: Second measurement

\end{itemize}
