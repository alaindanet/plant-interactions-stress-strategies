\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Positive interactions}
Positive interactions between plants have been studied a lot since the very influential paper of \citep{Bertness1994}, followed-up by \citep{Bruno2003}. In particular, \citet{Bertness1994} proposed the Stress Gradient Hypothesis (called here after SGH) which postulate that species interactions shift from competition to facilitation when the environment become harsher. Facilitation or positive interactions was originally defined when at least one organism benefit from another without cause harms to neither \citep{Bruno2003}. However, this definition moves slowly since \citet{Schob2014} showed the cost of facilitation for the benefactor.
By modifying local environment, a nurse (benefactor) plant can improve establishment of individuals under its canopy by for example decreasing wind, buffering extreme temperatures and increasing water infiltration \citep{Rietkerk1997}. 

Traditionally, studies examine plant interaction outcome by comparing the performance of a facilitated species (often a sapling) in a open site and under a nurse (usually an adult) along a stress gradient, natural (e.g altitude, grazers density) or manipulated (e.g. roofs or irrigation for water stress, controlled number of grazer and grazing duration for disturbance).
By this method, one concludes positive interactions are dominant if performance of the sapling is higher under a nurse than alone. Results showed that positive interactions between pair of plants become often dominant when the environment is harsh for survival of saplings, but result only in a reduction of competition for growth and reproduction\citep{He2013}.
Those studies were successful in highlighting that positive interactions between pairs of species may be more common than previously thought. Until now, no manipulative experimental study as far as we know has investigated facilitation at the community level insights. 

\subsection{Community level}
Recently, observational studies at community level take more importance in the literature \citep{Soliveres2012, Gross2013, Soliveres2014b} \textbf{Add more studies}. 
\citet{Soliveres2014} argue we "\textit{need more community-level studies and approaches assessing interactions among multiple species to understand better the consequences of facilitative interactions for the structure of whole communities}". 
I totally agree with this point but I think we missed a step by moving from experimental species pairs to observation of species co-occurrence. By studying pairs experimentally, we can access to mechanisms underlying interaction outcome. 
To access mechanisms at community level, I purpose to experimentally manipulate communities of facilitated saplings under a water and grazing treatment.
One cans imagine when a seed pool arrive in a site, some will germinate (of several species) and several saplings of different species experiment competition between them. Only few of these saplings will become an adult. Previous experiments suggest only one seed by site can germinate. So, the first objective of this studies is to add a step between pairs experiment and observational studies at community level.

\subsection{Functional approach}
Results of SGH investigation produced some contrasting results \citep{Maestre2009}. Several reviews used Grime's functional types to explain post-hoc general patterns of interaction outcome \citep{Maestre2009,Butterfield2013}. %Studies also proposed to disentangle interaction shift prediction if the stress is based on resource (e.g water), non-resource (e.g temperature) \citep{Maestre2009} or disturbance (e.g. grazing) \citep{Smit2009}. 
Grime functional types are a simple and pratical way to consider plant strategies. By classifying species, in competitive, stress tolerant or ruderal [what permit Grime classification...].
However, no studies as far we know explicitly take in account traits to explain species response in experimental design. As \citet{Butterfield2013} suggested, take a functional approach of facilitation will permit us to better understand the context dependence of facilitation. Functional ecology focus on rely plant traits to functions. 
For example, Surface Leaf Area (SLA) is relied to plant resource management. A low SLA indicate a individual which fastly acquire resource and vice et versa. Height of the plant is relied to to competitive ability for light. The second objective of this studies is to disentangle individual species responses by focusing on their traits and rely them to community response. 
[insert prediction table]
%Theory of coexistence in communities purpose species can coexist if their niches are different or because of environmental heterogeneity. So, more species have different traits, more they can coexist (limiting similarity). By doing an experiment at community level, we can suppose monoculture are more exposed to competition than mixture. This result could be have an impact on restoration strategies. We can also make hypothesis that nurse sites select on more competitive traits and open ones select on more stress traits. In the same way, community composition could modulate traits selection.[Can we have those kinds of result with one year-old saplings?...]

\subsection{Phenology}
Plant phenology describe timing of periodic event in life cycle (growing period,flowering, fructification), but is rarely brought forward in ecology.
However, phenology could be affected by climate change \citep{Cleland2007} because it varies across numerous factors but mainly by seasonal temperature and precipitation variations. By modification of local environment, facilitation could result in a modification of phenology. By modifying phenology between open and patch individuals, facilitation could result in a genetic differentiation between open and patch sub-population. As far we know, only studies of \citet{Castellanos2014} examined impact of facilitation on phenology. They found facilitation effect on flowering period for the start and the end of the season but no impact on the genetic differentiation. We want here to test impact of facilitation along a stress gradient on phenology. Are facilitation impact on phenology is modulated along a stress gradient ? Are different species are impacted in the same way ?

We also know variation in flowering timing is the important way to promote coexistence by limit competition on shared-pollinators \citep{Cleland2006}. We want to ask here how facilitation modulate phenology inside a community. If facilitation promote an phenology homogenization, it could paradoxically increase competition. 


\section{Methods}
\subsection{Site}
The experiment will take place near Alicante (South-East of Spain). Climate is semi-arid[...climate, soil, vegetation stuff]

\subsection{Plants}
Plant species were choosen based on spain reviews \citep{McCluney2012,Navarro2006, Jauffret2003}. According to those studies, we classified species which can be use in competitive or stress-tolerator. Susana asked for disponibility of \textit{Pistacia lentiscus}, \textit{Olea europaea} and \textit{Anthyllis citoides}. We used \textit{Artemisia herba-alba} adults as nurse plants.
% Information about seedlings: age, size, provenance, growth conditions.

\subsection{Design}
The design was fully randomized and orthogonal. It consists in 4 crossed treatments repeated in 4 terraces. The microsite treatment permits us the estimate relative importance of interactions. It tooks 2 modalities: "open" or "patch" (i.e. next to \textit{A.herba-alba}). We used same \textit{A.herba-alba} microsites than in a previous experiment in which microsites were randomly choosen. Open sites were placed at 1 meter from their associated \textit{A.herba-alba} sites. Water stress treatment tooks 2 modalities: "control" and "roofs" ("watering" if period is too dry). Grazing treatment tooks also 2 modalities: "control" and "grazing". Community treatment tooks 4 modalities: species 1, species 2, species 3 or mixture of the 3 species. All those treatments were crossed in each terrace (Schematic representation Figure \ref{exp}). We planted 3 saplings of the same species in the monoculture treatment and 1 sapling of each species in the mixture one.

Planting was done in the end of february 2015. We digged holes of 25*25*25 cm to plant and plants were been watered.
\begin{itemize} %Nombre de plantules
\item 2 microsites * 2 disturbance level * 2 water stress level * 4 types of community = 32 treatments
\item 32 treatments * 4 terraces * 8 replicates per terraces = 1024 microsites
\item 1024 microsites * 3 saplings per microsites = 3072 saplings 
\end{itemize}

To evaluate biomass of saplings across time, we have to keep few of them in green house to estimate biomass from height and branch. Saplings can be very plastic, \citet{Bonser1994} showed sapling invest more in height growth when they don't access to light and inversely invest more in branch when they access to light (maximise interception).
