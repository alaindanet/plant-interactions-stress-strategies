\part{Introduction}
The theory of Stress Gradient Hypothesis (SGH) predict basicly a increasing of facilitation importance when stress increase. This hypothesis has been widely tested and stay still in debate because of opposite results. Two of main obstacles are (i) the fact all the species have not the same potential to be facilited and conversely all the species have not the same potentiel to facilitate; (ii) We have not the same assumptions if the "stress" is based on stress (eg water) or disturbance (eg grazing) (sensu Grime).

As \citet{Butterfield2013} suggested, take a functional approach of facilitation will permit us to better understand the context dependance of facilitation. He predicts stress would result in facilitation of competitive species and disturbance would result in facilitation of competitive or stress-tolerator species. So far, we don't know any experimental studies which have explicitly related Grime plant strategies to SGH. On the other hand, some observational studies described plant strategies along grazing gradient \citep{DIAZ2007}.

The conceptual model of Grime predict the dominant plant strategies along stress and disturbance gradient (Competitive, Stress-tolerator and Ruderals) and SGH predict importance of interaction type along stress and disturbance gradient.

The goal of this studies is to make a conceptual link between Grime and SGH model: (i) Facilitation can modulate Grime predictions ? (ii) Which strategies is the most facilitated along a stress and disturbance gradient ?

\part{Methods}

\section{Site}

The experiment will take in Alicante. Mart's field sites are free to use and those sites seem perfect.

\section{Plants}

To following Grime plant strategies, the best would be to choose species which are enough caricatural. A first axis to separate  quite clear to separate species  difference of ressources management is the SLA (Surface Leaf Area). SLA is linked to maximum photosynthesis speed and leaf life span. A low SLA means conservative strategie (low photosynthesis speed and long leaf life span) and high SLA an acquisition strategie. This axis discriminates S and C-R strategies. C and R are different in term of stature and seed investment. On the contrary of R, C have a high canopy an invest low ressources in seeds.

It's a very simple way to define plant strategies and may be I can refine it with C-S, S-R and S-C Grime (1979) but the main idea is here. 


\section{Design}

The design would be to plant 3 saplings of 3 different species, each one representing a Grime strategie (See Figure \ref{exp}). An alternative would be to test a set of 2 saplings by treatment: Competitive vs Stress-tolerator for Stress (Water), Competitive vs Ruderals for disturbance gradient (grazing) because we have not hypothesis with for the third sapling. We will have a water-stress treatment provided by Susana's roof which exclude a bit less than 30\% of rainfall. I propose to keep only 2 cattle grazing treatment ( low and high) and abondon rabbit treatment. Finally, of course, a treatment open/nurse to have interaction balance.

\end{figure}

Table \ref{hyp} shows assumptions about results of winning strategies according to stress or disturbance. In Summary, (i) we can think facilitation modulate Grime's prediction, (ii) we also make hypothesis that different strategies have different potential to be facilited.

\end{tabular} 
\end{center}

\end{table}

\section{Measurements}
It would be good to measure height canopy and survival regularly to have dynamics of competition. Finally, the final output of competition would be an idea of seed production.


\section{Timing}
\begin{itemize}

\item January: Species choice have to be done, idem for experimental design.
\item February: Growth of saplings in green house.
\item March: plant saplings, watering them to prevent transplant mortality.
\item June or july: may be one visit to make sure everything is fine and water plants.
\item October: first measure and after application of grazing and water treatment.
\item March: Second measurement

\end{itemize}
