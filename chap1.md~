Introduction
============

General context
---------------

In the context of global change, the ecosystems are susceptible to be
modified by the pressure change. Ecosystems can response in different
ways to a pressure change. Some of them respond gradually to a increase
of pressure, others respond in a abrupt way and finally some of them
respond by a catastrophic shift. In the arid ecosystem, which covers 40%
of the world land surface, are susceptible to respond by a catastrophic
shift [@Kefi2007]. Several hypothesis have been suggested and previous
works shows that the interactions between plants play a key role in the
catastrophic shifts [@Rietkerk2004; @Kefi2007]. In particular, the
positive interactions between plants seem to be responsible for positive
feedback between water and vegetation which cause the catastrophic
shifts [@Walker1981]. By improving local conditions , the adult plants
allow the recruitment of new individuals under their canopy. The
question of how the interactions between plants would be affected by the
climate change is thus crucial. Furthermore, the inclusion of the
positive interactions in the ecological framework is fundamental
[@Bruno2003].

Positive interactions
---------------------

Positive interactions between plants have been studied a lot since the
very influential paper of [@Bertness1994], followed-up by [@Bruno2003].
In particular, @Bertness1994 proposed the Stress Gradient Hypothesis
(called hereafter SGH), which postulates that species interactions shift
from competition to facilitation when the environment becomes harsher.
Facilitation, or positive interaction, was originally defined as a
situation where one organism benefits from another without causing harm
to neither [@Bruno2003]. However, this definition has changed slowly
since @Schob2014 who showed that there can be a cost of facilitation for
the benefactor. By modifying the local environment, a plant benefactor
can improve the establishment of individuals under its canopy by, for
example, decreasing wind, buffering extreme temperatures and increasing
water infiltration [@Rietkerk1997].

Traditionally, studies have examined plant interaction outcome by
comparing the performance of a facilitated species (often a sapling) in
a open site and under a nurse (usually an adult) along a stress
gradient, natural (e.g. altitude, grazers density) or manipulated (e.g.
roofs or irrigation for water stress, controlled number of grazer and
grazing duration for disturbance). We use sapling beacause early stages
survival are considered the most critical stage of the plant. Using this
approach, one concludes that positive interactions are dominant if the
performance of the sapling is higher under a nurse than alone. Results
showed that net interactions between pairs of plants become often
positive for survival of saplings when the environment is harsh, but not
for growth and reproduction [@He2013]. Those studies were successful in
highlighting that positive interactions between pairs of species may be
more common than previously thought. However, until now, no manipulative
experimental study, as far as we know, has investigated facilitation at
the community level.

Community level
---------------

Recently, observational studies at the community level have become more
important in the literature
[@Soliveres2012; @Gross2013; @Soliveres2014b; @cavieres_facilitative_2014].
@Soliveres2014 argue that we “*need more community-level studies and
approaches assessing interactions among multiple species to understand
better the consequences of facilitative interactions for the structure
of whole communities*”. While I agree with this statement, I think that
we might miss an important step if we move directly from experiments
investigating pairs of species to observations of species
co-occurrences. By studying pairs experimentally, we can access the
mechanisms underlying the interaction outcome. To access the mechanisms
at community level, I propose to experimentally manipulate communities
of saplings under a water and grazing treatment. One can imagine that
when a seed pool arrives in a site, some will germinate (of several
species) and several saplings of different species will experiment
competition with each other. Only few of these saplings will become an
adult. Previous experiments have only considered the case where one seed
germinates under a patch (pair experiments). Here, we want to be more
realistic by investigating competition between several saplings until
their establishment. So, the first objective of this study is to add a
step between pair experiments and observational studies by working at
the community level. As discussed in the previous section, in the dry
environments, the saplings often etablished under a patch. While we know
a lot about interactions between one sapling species and an adult, it is
not yet know how a community of saplings can react.

Functional approach
-------------------

SGH investigations have produced contrasting results [@Maestre2009].
Several studies used Grime’s functional types to explain post-hoc
general patterns of interaction outcome
[@Maestre2009; @Butterfield2013; @Michalet2006]. This is a simple and
practical way to consider plant strategies. By classifying species as
competitive, stress tolerant or ruderal (CSR), we can better understand
succession processes [@Raevel2012] and vegetation turnover under stress
and disturbance. “Competitive” plants (C) are able to dominate when
stress and disturbance are low, “stress tolerant” (S) when stress is
high and disturbance is low and “ruderal” ones (R) when stress is low
and disturbance high.Functional ecology focuses on connecting plant
traits to plant functions. For example, the Specific Leaf Area (SLA) is
related to plant resource management [@Grime1976], a low SLA indicating
an individual which quickly acquires resource and vice et versa. Plant
height is related to competitive ability for light. So S-plants are
characterised by a high SLA and a low growth-rate. On the contrary,
C-plants and R-plants are characterised by a low SLA and a high growth
rate. R-plants are distinguished by the fact they invest more in seeds
while C-plants invest more in height growth. Although this
classification was originaly designed on the herbaceous plants of Great
Britain [@Grime1976], @frenette-dussault_functional_2012 successfully
described those syndromes in the arid ecosystems of Morocco.

It has been argued in the literature that the interaction outcome along
a stress gradient will differ depending on the species that compose the
sapling/adult pair (e.g. C-plant/C-plant, C-plant/S-plant or
S-plant/S-plant) [@Maestre2009] based on analysis of previous results.

However no study, as far we know, has explicitly taken in account the
species traits to explain species response in an experimental design. As
@Butterfield2013 suggested, taking a functional approach of facilitation
will allow us to better understand the context-dependence of
facilitation. The second objective of this studies is to disentangle
individual species responses by focusing on their traits and relating
them to the community response.

Phenology
---------

Plant phenology describes the timing of periodic events in the life
cycle (growing period, flowering, fructification) but is rarely brought
forward in ecology. However, phenology could be affected by climate
change [@Cleland2007] because it varies depending numerous factors,
mainly seasonal temperature and precipitation variations. By modifying
the local environment, facilitation could therefore affect the
phenology. Moreover, by modifying the phenology differently in open and
in patch areas, facilitation could result in a genetic differentiation
between open and patch sub-populations. As far we know, only the study
of @Castellanos2014 examined the impact of facilitation on phenology.
They found that facilitation affects the flowering timing at the start
and at the end of the season but they did not find genetic
differentiation. Here, we want to test the effect of facilitation on
phenology along a stress gradient. Are different species impacted in the
same way ?

We also know that variations in the flowering timing is an important way
to promote coexistence by limiting competition on shared-pollinators
[@Cleland2006]. Here we want to ask how facilitation modulates phenology
inside a community. If facilitation promotes a phenology homogenization,
it could paradoxically increase competition.

In sum, this project aims at addressing the following research
questions:

-   Can we predict the species responses to facilitation based on its
    functional group?

-   How do the species response to facilitation can be affected by the
    interspecific competition ?

-   Can we infer the interaction strength from co-occurrence
    observations ?

Methods
=======

Site
----

The experiment will take place near Alicante (South-East of Spain).
Climate is semi-arid[...climate, soil, vegetation stuff]

Benefaciary species
-------------------

Plant species were chosen based on Spanish literature reviews
[@McCluney2012; @Navarro2006; @Jauffret2003]. According to those
studies, we identified species which could be considered as competitive
or stress-tolerator. For the pilot, we will use *Pistacia lentiscus*
(competitive), *Atriplex glauca* (ruderal) and *Anthyllis citoides*
(stress tolerant). We are going to use *Artemisia herba-alba* adults as
patch plants. For the real experiment, we will replace *A.glauca* by
*(Monicambia?)*. Saplings were grown in controlled conditions in a
nursery (Viveros Muzalé S.L.) located in Abanilla (South-East of Spain,
Province of Murcia).

Design
------

We set up a randomized block design. It consists in 4 crossed variables
repeated in 4 terraces. The microsite variable allows us to estimate the
relative importance of the interactions between the beneciary and the
benefactor. It has 2 modalities: “open” or “patch” (i.e. below an adult
*A.herba-alba*). We will use same *A.herba-alba* microsites than in a
previous experiment in which microsites were randomly chosen
(Verwijmeren, in prep). Open sites are placed at 1 meter from their
associated *A.herba-alba* sites. The water stress variable has 2
treatments: “control” and “watering”. The grazing variable has also 2
treatments: “control” and “grazing”. The community variable has 4
treatments: species 1, species 2, species 3 or mixture of the 3 species.
All those treatments are crossed in each terrace (Schematic
representation Figure [exp]). We are going to plant 3 saplings of the
same species in the monoculture treatment and 1 sapling of each species
in the mixture one (i.e. 3 saplings in each case).

Planting will be done in March 2015. We are going to dig holes of
25\*25\*25 cm to plant the saplings which will be watered. The 3
saplings will be put in the same hole to insure that they will be in
interaction and so, constitute a community. Furthermore, we will place
the saplings in triangular way. Thus, the 3 saplings will be at the same
distance from each other. For the patch sites, the holes were oriented
to the north. In this way, saplings will receive most shading from
*A.herba-alba*.

To summarize, there will be:

-   2 microsites [open/patch] \* 2 disturbance level [grazing/no] \* 2
    water stress level [watered/no] \* 4 types of community [3
    mono/mixture] = 32 treatments

-   32 treatments \* 4 terraces \* 8 replicates per terrace = 1024
    microsites

-   1024 microsites \* 3 saplings per microsites = 3072 saplings

Notes to discuss:

-   Number of saplings seems too large.

-   Why not focus on one stress ? Discuss possible collaboration with
    Susana student.

-   How to simulate grazing if we keep the grazing gradient ?

#### SLA

The Specific Leaf Area (SLA) is often used because it is correlated with
RGR (Relative Growth Rate). We used a standardized method
@perez-harguindeguy_new_2013. The samples sould be put immediatly in a
tube containing distilled water to prevent dissecation or should be wrap
in most paper and put in a bag (detailled method in
[@perez-harguindeguy_new_2013]). The measurement should be realized
within 24h. The area of the leaf can be determined by using a scanner
and the surface can be calibrated using an object with a known area.

### Interaction indices

[...] Detail available indices [@Seifan2010].

### Species responses to stress: determinate the place of the species in the CSR diagram

We will analyse the species response in the monoculture/open combination
of treatments. Compare to control, the C-plants should answer (in term
of growth) the most to the watering treatment and S-plants the least.
R-plants should be the least impacted by the grazing treatment and the
C-plants should be the most impacted. The response of the R-plants
should be the most important in the combination of watering and grazing
treatment and the S-plant should response the least. All those
predictions can be resumed in figure [pred]A.

### Do facilitation modulate those responses ?

As mentioned in the literature, we can make the hypothesis that the
species, representing each one functional type, will show different
responses following to which distance to their ecological optimum the
stress or/and disturbance led them. As we show in the figure [pred]B,
the C-plants would be the most facilitated species since they will be
the farthest of their ecological optimum and the S-plants would be the
less facilitated species because on the contrary, because the control
will represent the treatment the nearest of ecological optimum of
S-plants. In the watered treatment, the R- and C-plants would be
negatively affected by the presence of *A.herba-alba* of shading. Still
in the watered treatment, the outcome of interaction could be null
between the S-plants and *A.herba-alba* because they would be have
enough resources for both of them and in the same time, adaptations to
stress are often correlated to shade-tolerance [@Grime1977a]. In the
grazing treatment, the C-plants could be the most facilitated by
*A.herba-alba* since they will profit of micro-habitat amelioration and
protection from grazing. The S-plants would be less facilitated since
they will only profit from grazing protection (see the prediction for
the previous treatment). The outcome of interaction between the R-plants
and *A.herba-alba* is excepted to null because they will profit of
micro-habitat amelioration but will be affected by shading for growth
whereas in open site, they would be affected by water restriction but
they can grow after grazing event. In the combined treatment of watering
and grazing, the R-plants could experiment competition in the presence
of *A.herba-alba* because they will be near of their ecological optimum.
On the contrary, the S- and C-plants could experiment facilitation
because they will be protected from grazing.

most important interaction is the competition.[pred]](prediction.pdf)
