# Functional theory of catastrophic shifts

Put traits in the theory (performance measure along gradients of stress and disturbance).

New indicators: decrease of intraspecific variability of traits using the
framework of Violle et al. (2012). Detect traits which have important variation
in gradient of stress and disturbance.

Model: modelisation of not species but traits.

Restoration: Using traits data from stress gradient to select species or
individuals which would be able to survive.
